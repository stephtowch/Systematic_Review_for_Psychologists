During their observation of this interaction, Ss expected to evaluate and later work with either the dominant or the submissive person. Ss' skin conductance was monitored as they observed and evaluated these target persons. As predicted, Ss responded to the motive-threatening target person with greater autonomic arousal; this association was stronger among Ss who typically used denial as a defense mechanism. Defensive devaluation by dominance-oriented Ss was associated with subsequent lower arousal.

The following were among the major results: (a) Previously found interaction patterns between elderly residents and their social partners, replicated in both a nursing home and a home for the chronically ill, supported the notion of discrepant social ecologies for dependent versus independent behaviors of residents; (b) specification of each behavioral act as to its dyadic form underscored the fact that the interactions were controlled largely by social partners and not by the elderly residents; (c) coding continuity or discontinuity of behavior suggested that independent behaviors were maintained by chaining; and (d) elderly residents in the home for the chronically ill evinced, as expected, more dependence-related behaviors.

A test of the model, using data from 529 WUs in 60 employment-security offices, shows that WUs facing conflicting contingencies are more prone to design misfit and lower performance. Moreover, an MC approach (1) provided information about patterns of design in WUs that a unidimensional approach would not have, (2) isolated instances in which equifinality could be observed, and (3) provided insight into the phenomenon of the misfit and the difficulties of observing it.

One component of his work was the development of a taxonomy for classifying precipitants of relapse. This taxonomy has been incorporated into the nomenclature of clinicians and clinical researchers as part of an explanatory framework for understanding relapses. Despite the taxonomy's influence it has never been examined for the reliability of its use across research studies. The present study compared the reliability of independent classifications of 149 relapse episodes by trained raters at three research laboratories. Despite considerable across-laboratory training, reliability was found to be inconsistent for research purposes. It is concluded that comparability of results based on Mariatt's relapse taxonomy across independent studies must be subject to question, and assumptions necessary for the aggregation of a knowledge base are not supported. Recommendations are offered for improving the reliability of the taxonomy and the methods used to collect taxonomy data.

In contrast to placebo, caffeine protected the ex-smokers from a surge of anxiety and rise in blood pressure associated with exposure to smoking-related cues. Caffeine had no significant effects on the control group at this dose (equivalent to a single cup of strong coffee). The results are discussed with reference to J. Stewart's conditioned appetitive motivational model of addiction. It is suggested that further work may identify caffeine as an adjunct to smoking relapse prevention measures.

Chapman_1997_Addi,JOUR,1997-06380-006,Chapman and Simon and Haddad and Suzy and Sindhusake and Doungkamol,Do work-place smoking bans cause smokers to smoke 'harder'? Results from a naturalistic observational study,Addiction,1997,92,5,607-610,Blackwell Publishing,0965-2140 and 1360-0443,NA,"Examined whether smokers outside buildings with work-place smoking bans smoke 'harder' than those smoking in social settings. An unobtrusive random observational study of smokers followed by structured interview was used, with 143 smokers taking smoking breaks outside their office buildings and 113 smokers in social settings. The main outcome measurements were number of puffs per cigarette and cigarette smoking duration. The mean number of puffs per cigarette for the office building group (OFB Ss) was 18.7% greater than that for the social settings group (SST Ss); 74.8% OFB Ss took more than the mean number of puffs for the group compared to 42.5% of SST Ss. Mean cigarette smoking duration was 30.4% shorter for the OFB Ss than for the SST Ss. Of OFB Ss, 55.2% had a cigarette smoking duration between 3<e2><80><93>4.59 min, while 53.1% of SST Ss took less than 5 min to smoke the observed cigarette. Regardless of degree of nicotine dependency, smokers leaving work-stations to smoke outside buildings smoked their cigarettes nearly 19% 'harder' than cigarettes smoked in social settings. The individual and public health benefits of reduced smoking frequency engendered by work-place smoking bans may be lessened by policies which allow smokers to take smoking breaks.

Potential participants were identified through magazine advertisements, user profiles on a popular online service, and escort web sites and were sent an e-mail inviting them to call a project number for more information. 50 men (aged 22-47 yrs) completed a face-to-face interview and quantitative instruments, which assessed HIV sexual risk behaviors with work and nonwork partners, sexual compulsivity, sexual sensation seeking, and a measure of self-confidence. Sexual compulsivity was associated with higher frequency of engaging in HIV sexual risk behaviors. Lower self-confidence and higher sexual sensation seeking were found to be associated with sexual compulsivity, accounting for 36% of the total variance.

It was found that the vast majority of prostitutes in both cohorts were drug users, although a significantly greater proportion of women in 1999 used drugs than in 1989. While the proportion of drug users who inject has remained constant, the proportion 'ever' sharing injecting equipment fell. Although condom use for commercial sex was the norm, women were not using condoms for sex with regular partners. In 1999, almost half of the women had been subject to violent assault and almost 40% to sexual assault while working. The authors contend that consideration should be given to the introduction of a methadone service for prostitutes in the city with a view to reducing their demand for illicit drugs. It is argued that if their demand for illicit drugs were reduced as a result of such a methadone programme, so too might the amount of time they required to work to fund their drug dependence, which would in turn reduce their vulnerability to violence and assault.

An exploratory analysis examined whether the older Ss differed from their younger incarcerated cohorts on underlying trait and temperament scales. Similar to both community samples and incarcerated men, older Ss had lower rates of personality disorders than younger Ss, and the difference was mostly accounted for by differences in the Cluster B disorders. In an exploratory analysis of trait and temperament scales, the older Ss also scored lower in Aggression, Disinhibition, Entitlement, Exhibitionism, Impulsivity, and Manipulativeness while younger Ss scored lower in Workaholism and Propriety.

This article investigates lay persons' (aged 35-47 yrs old) strategies in relation to work and musculoskeletal disorders. Twenty interviews were conducted and analysed using grounded theory. A typology of self-presentations was developed. The interviewees' self-presentations revealed a strong sense of a 'duty to work'. This sense of duty took four different forms, leading us to categorise persons expressing particular forms as workaholics, work manics, workhorses or relaxed workers. Relaxed workers seem to have the best prognosis for recovery as they had a confident self-agency and worked to fulfill their own needs rather than those of others. This was in contrast to work manics, with an uncertain self-agency and driven to work by others' needs. In conclusion, awareness of such linguistic forms as self-attributions and idiomatic phrases provides an opportunity to identify and talk about individual's self-agency and driving forces in the recovery process.

In Study 2A, a multidimensional configuration of 229 of these male and female types was derived from a free sorting task among a new set of participants.

Data are from a national survey of active physicians in the US fielded between August 1998 and November 1999. 566 psychiatrists, 7,217 primary care physicians, and 4,521 other medical or surgical specialists completed the survey. Psychiatrists are significantly less likely than primary care physicians or other specialists to agree with the statements that clinical decisions in the interest of their patients do not reduce income. Further, in comparison to primary care physicians, psychiatrists are less likely to agree that it is possible to maintain continuing relationships with patients over time that promote the delivery of high quality care and that they have the freedom to make clinical decisions that meet their patients' needs. Psychiatrists tend to work in practices with a lower dependence on managed care than either other specialists or primary care physicians. Psychiatrists are less likely than other physicians to have their income adjusted based on individual productivity. Psychiatrists are more concerned that managed care has a negative impact on patient-provider relationships; however, psychiatrists are less dependent on managed care.

Conceptual links made with the transactional model of stress suggest that workaholics focus on work at the expense of personal relationships. The present research tested the proposition that workaholics deny their workaholism and experience greater disturbances in close relationships than do non-workaholics. In addition to workers' own self-ratings, ratings from their partner or spouse were also obtained. Workaholics' ratings of their levels of enjoyment were not significantly different from their partners' ratings, but their self-ratings of drive were significantly higher than partners' ratings. Workaholic and non-workaholic dyads reported similar levels of relationship adjustment. The data indicated that workaholics' self-ratings of their level of workaholism were similar to the ratings provided by their spouse/partner, and that satisfaction with their personal relationship (with their spouse or partner) was minimally affected by workaholism. The data suggest that intimate relationships may act as stress buffers for workaholics.

Confirmatory factor analysis (total N = 356) revealed that the factorial structure of the Dutch WART was similar to that of the US original. Study 2 (N = 232) examined whether the Compulsive Tendencies (CT) subscale of the WART could be used as a short measure of workaholism. The overlap between the full 25-item WART and the CT subscale was high, whereas the patterns of correlations with other concepts were very similar. Study 3 (N = 199) tested a process model for the effects of workaholism (i.e., CT) on exhaustion and work-nonwork conflict, showing that workaholism affected these two outcome variables both directly and indirectly (via perceived job demands). It is concluded that: (i) the Dutch version of the WART is very similar to the US original; (ii) the WART and the CT subscale are both valid measures of workaholism; and (iii) workaholism is a potentially important concept in the study of work and stress.

This exploratory study examined the relationship of three workaholism components with measures of workplace destructive and constructive deviance. Data were collected from 142 male and female employees working in six companies in Brazil using anonymously completed questionnaires. The results suggest that the workaholism components were significantly related to two measures of deviance. This provides partial support for the hypothesized relationship.

The authors identified three clusters of individuals, one of which corresponded to Spence and Robbins's profile of the workaholic (high work involvement, high drive to work, low work enjoyment). Consistent with previously conjectured relations with workaholism, individuals in the workaholic cluster were more likely to label themselves as workaholics, more likely to have acquaintances label them as workaholics, and more likely to have lower life satisfaction and higher work-life imbalance.

A total of 32 (58.2%) patients who responded to treatment and 23 (41.8%) who did not, were compared in terms of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. The authors' findings demonstrated that the severity of obsession-compulsions and disability in work, social and family lives at the beginning of treatment were significantly higher in OCD patients who did not respond to treatment in comparison to those who did. Linear regression analysis, however, revealed that Sheehan Disability Scale-work score at baseline was a predictor of response to SSRI treatment.

Although the objectives of gambling machines and addiction therapeutics are seemingly at odds--the first work to encourage play, the second to stop it--both gear their interventions around a model of the self as a continuum of behavioral potentials that can be externally modulated. For compulsive gamblers implicated in this circuit of modulation, pharmaceutical drugs that have been prescribed to dampen cravings for machine play sometimes function as intensifiers of its effects. Caught in an intractable play between technologies of harm and technologies of care, recovering gambling addicts are challenged to assemble a technical array through which they can maintain balance; health itself, for these individuals, becomes a state of managed dependency. This essay explores the shifting terms and changing stakes of subjectivity and health in the contemporary United States by way of ethnographic research on compulsive gamblers who live and work in Las Vegas. The analysis draws on interviews with gamblers as well as on observations in local self-help groups, directed group therapy sessions, and chat rooms of Internet recovery Web sites.

Further, they specified whether their job was characterized by physical workload, overtime, or stress, and evaluated whether they feel impaired by each job characteristic. Results show that substance abuse/dependence (including nicotine dependence) was the highest prevalent mental disorder in German employees (12 month prevalence: 14.4%; only alcohol and illicit substance abuse/dependence: 4.9%) followed by anxiety (12.0%) somatoform (9.7%), and affective (9.3%) disorders. Sequential logistic regression analyses showed significant associations between the presence of stress at work and affective and somatoform disorders. Furthermore, feeling impaired by stress at work was strongly associated with anxiety, affective, somatoform disorders, and substance abuse/dependence. Beside work, personal characteristics, primarily gender, were associated with mental disorders in employees. However, except for affective disorders, gender did not modify the association between job characteristics and mental disorders. Taken together, results corroborate the necessity of considering mental disorders at work. Further studies to define the relation between work and mental disorders in employees are strongly recommended and should include objective analyses of job characteristics.

This article summarizes a 27-year program of research that has attempted to improve early maternal and child health and future life options with prenatal and infancy home visiting by nurses. The program is designed for low-income mothers who have had no previous live births. The home-visiting nurses have three major goals: to improve the outcomes of pregnancy by helping women improve their prenatal health, to improve the child's health and development by helping parents provide more sensitive and competent care of the child, and to improve parental life course by helping parents plan future pregnancies, complete their education, and find work. The program has been tested in three separate large-scale, randomized controlled trials with different populations living in different contexts. Results from these trials indicate that the program has been successful in achieving two of its most important goals: (a) the improvement of parental care of the child as reflected in fewer injuries and ingestions that may be associated with child abuse and neglect and better infant emotional and language development; and (b) the improvement of maternal life course, reflected in fewer subsequent pregnancies, greater work-force participation, and reduced dependence on public assistance and food stamps. The impact on pregnancy outcomes is equivocal. In the first trial, the program also produced long-term effects on the number of arrests, convictions, emergent substance use, and promiscuous sexual activity of 15-year-old children whose nurse-visited mothers were low-income and unmarried when they registered in the study during pregnancy. In general, the impact of the program was greater on those segments of the population at greater risk for the particular outcome domain under examination. Since 1996, the program has been offered for public investment outside of research contexts. Careful attention has been given to ensuring that organizational and community contexts are favorable for development of the program, to providing excellent training and guidance to the nurses in their use of the program's visit-by-visit guidelines, to monitoring the functioning of the program with a comprehensive clinical information system, and to improving the performance of the programs over time with continuous improvement strategies.

However, the potentially confounding effect of nicotine on studies of cognition in detoxified substance users has rarely been addressed. In the current study of 87 participants, behavioral and electrophysiological indices of cognitive efficiency were measured in tobacco smokers from four groups: alcoholics, illicit stimulant abusers, concurrent abusers, and control subjects. Data were collected from 2001 to 2003. We hypothesized that acute nicotine administration would modify cognitive deficits in alcoholics and illicit stimulant abusing groups. An adaptation of the Rapid Visual Information Processing task was administered after stabilization of nicotine levels via a high- or low-dose transdermal nicotine patch. Across groups, increased nicotine dose was associated with decreased reaction time (p = .03). A group <c3><97> nicotine dose interaction trend was noted in which increased nicotine was associated with increased correct responding within the alcoholic group (p = .02). No significant differences in electrophysiology were observed.

The Therapeutic Workplace has promoted abstinence from heroin and cocaine in treatment-resistant mothers in methadone treatment. This study attempted to replicate that effect in crack cocaine users recruited from community-based methadone programs. Participants were randomly assigned to a Therapeutic Workplace (n=22) or usual care control (n=25) group. Therapeutic Workplace participants were invited to work in the workplace and earn vouchers every weekday for 9 months contingent on documented opiate and cocaine abstinence. The two groups did not differ significantly on measures of cocaine or opiate use collected during study participation. Daily attendance and urinalysis results of the Therapeutic Workplace group were analyzed, and only 7 of the 22 participants initiated consistent periods of abstinence and workplace attendance. Two individuals gained access to the workplace on a few days, and 9 participants attempted to gain access to the workplace but never provided a drug-negative urine sample. Possible reasons for differences between the current study and the previous Therapeutic Workplace study are considered.

This paper describes the HPRS; provides information about its administration, scoring, and interpretation; and describes the initial research conducted to validate the scale. The results clearly indicate that the scale (1) has good reliability, (2) is strong enough in terms of its measurement error traits to recommend it for use in educational, research, and clinical settings, and (3) appears to be acceptable in terms of its content and construct validity.

Two hundred and thirty-five bank employees completed questionnaires measuring workaholism, job stress, burnout, work engagement, and SHC. Factor analyses suggested a two-factor model of workaholism, 'Drive' and 'Enjoyment of Work'. There were significant relations between workaholism subscales and SHC, job stress, burnout, and work engagement. The 'Drive' subscale correlated positively with job stress and SHC, and marginally with burnout and work engagement. The 'Enjoyment of Work' subscale correlated negatively with job stress, burnout, and SHC. The results showed that a two-factor model of workaholism provided the best fit for Norwegian data, supported a differentiation of enthusiastic and nonenthusiastic workaholic features, and were related in predictable ways to SHC, burnout, and work engagement, as predicted from contemporary cognitive stress theory.

It was found that gender and years of cohabitating were significantly related to Emotional aggression and Sexual violence; lifestyle patterns were associated with specific forms of violence. More specifically, the lifestyles of Pleasure & Elegance and the one of Culture-Intellectualism were found to promote Emotional aggression. Also, the lifestyle of Yuppies/Workaholic and that of Physical activities stimulated the appearance of Sexual violence between partners. Moreover, individuals with Tradition-Religiousness lifestyle were more likely to show lower levels of Physical & Sexual violence while the adherents of the Substance abuse lifestyle pattern appeared to have an inclination towards Physical & Sexual violence.

Personal factors such as demographic information, disease severity, cognition, and degree of brain injury were also assessed. t-tests showed that persons with SLE worked significantly less than healthy controls but there were no significant differences between the groups for types of job or employee restrictions.

Four-hundred and twenty-seven physicians known to treat addicted patients in non-private settings were recruited and agreed to participate. Each physician provided clinical and anonymous information on the first 6 consecutive patients who attended on a scheduled day. A total of 2361 patients were interviewed (92.1%) and data were obtained concerning gender, age, work, educational level, civil status, addiction diagnosis, type of treatment and psychiatric comorbidity. Seven-hundred and ninety-eight out of 2361 addicts (33.8%) presented with a dual diagnosis. Depression was the most prevalent disorder (21.6%), followed by anxiety disorders (11.7%). Comorbidity was found to be related to age, female gender, divorce and widowhood, and higher educational levels. Alcoholics who abused other drugs showed the highest rates of comorbidity (48.5%), while opiate addicts were at the lower end of the spectrum (27.4%). No differences were found related to the treatment setting, the doctor's medical specialty, or the geographical area. Finally, doctors tended to perceive that dual diagnosis was related to a worse psychiatric prognosis but not to higher relapse rates. Antidepressants were the most commonly prescribed drugs (62.4% of comorbid patients) and anticraving agents were prescribed equally to comorbid and non-comorbid patients. Within the limitations of a descriptive study, our data show that comorbidity is a common clinical problem in patients who access addiction treatment. Affective and anxiety disorders are the most common comorbid diseases, and comorbidity rates seem to be unrelated to regional differences, medical settings or doctor's professional background. Dual diagnosis patients thus account for one third of the clinical workload of addiction specialists in Spain.

The results, using two different measures of workaholism (Workaholism Battery, Work Addiction Risk Test), indicated that greater scores on the Workaholic Risk Test were significantly related to greater work-family conflict and less gratification with leisure (or nonwork) time. In terms of the Workaholism Battery, high Drive scores were also found to relate to more work-family conflict. However, Work Enjoyment scores were associated with less work-family conflict, as well as greater scores indicative of satisfaction with the job and the work itself.

Findings indicate that managers are mainly interested in the performance of their department or work unit, and work-life policies are often seen as disruptive.

We also explored the prevalence of these types of overtime and how they were related to work and personal characteristics. A survey was conducted among a representative sample of Dutch full-time employees (N = 1612). AN(C)OVA was used to compare rewarded and unrewarded, voluntary and involuntary overtime workers on personal and work characteristics, fatigue, and work satisfaction. Most overtime workers were rewarded (62%). About half of the sample (n = 814) could be classified as either voluntary or involuntary overtime workers, or as having 'mixed reasons' to work overtime. Voluntary and unrewarded overtime workers had a relatively high income and favourable job characteristics. Involuntary overtime work was associated with relatively high fatigue and low satisfaction, especially for involuntary overtime workers without rewards who can be considered a burnout risk group. Voluntary overtime workers were non-fatigued and satisfied, even without rewards. It can be concluded that control over overtime and rewards for overtime are important for well-being. Moderate overtime work may not be a problem if it is done voluntarily. Moreover, the negative effects of compulsory overtime work may be partly offset by fair compensation for the extra work.

These aversive aspects of nicotine withdrawal and the rewarding effects of nicotine play major roles in maintaining nicotine dependence. Objectives: The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of desipramine (DMI), a preferential norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and antidepressant, on preclinical models of nicotine dependence in rats. Materials and methods: A rate-independent current-intensity discrete-trial threshold intracranial self-stimulation procedure was used to assess brain reward function during nicotine withdrawal induced by cessation of nicotine infusion via subcutaneous osmotic mini pumps (3.16 mg/kg/day, base). Nicotine withdrawal was also measured by somatic signs of withdrawal. DMI was administered acutely (2 or 5 mg/kg, salt) during nicotine/saline withdrawal. In other na<c3><af>ve rats, chronic DMI treatment via mini pump (15 mg/kg/day, salt) began after 7 days of nicotine/saline exposure and continued during administration of nicotine/saline for 14 days and during nicotine/saline withdrawal. Additional rats acquired intravenous nicotine- or food-maintained responding, were prepared with DMI/vehicle-containing mini pumps, and selfadministered nicotine or food during 12 days of DMI/vehicle exposure. Results: Acute DMI administration had no effect on threshold elevations observed in nicotine-withdrawing rats. Chronic DMI administration prevented the reward threshold elevations and the increased somatic signs of nicotine withdrawal. Although chronic DMI significantly decreased nicotine self-administration, it also decreased food-maintained responding. Conclusions: The results suggest that norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors may be effective anti-smoking treatments that reduce the anhedonic depression-like and somatic components of nicotine withdrawal and may alter the rewarding effects of nicotine and food.

Box 980613, Richmond, VA, US, 23298-0613","Rationale: Adolescent smoking is an increasing epidemic in the US. Research has shown that the commencement of smoking at a young age increases addiction and decreases the probability of successful cessation; however, limited work has focused on nicotine dependence in the female. Objective: The goal of the present study was to identify the biological and behavioral factors that may contribute to nicotine's increased abuse liability in female adolescents using animal models of nicotine dependence. Materials and Methods: Early adolescent (PND 28) and adult (PND 70) female mice were compared in various aspects of nicotine dependence using reward and withdrawal models following sub-chronic nicotine exposure. Furthermore, in vivo acute sensitivity and tolerance to nicotine were examined. Results: In the conditioned place preference model, adolescents demonstrated a significant preference at 0.5 mg/kg nicotine, an inactive dose in adults. Adults found higher doses (0.7 and 1.0 mg/kg) of nicotine to elicit rewarding effects. Furthermore, adolescents displayed increased physical, but not affective, withdrawal signs in three models. Upon acute exposure to nicotine, adolescent mice showed increased sensitivity in an analgesic measure as well as hypothermia. After chronic nicotine exposure, both adults and adolescents displayed tolerance to nicotine with adolescents having a lower degree of tolerance to changes in body temperature. Conclusions: These data indicate that differences in nicotine's rewarding and aversive effects may contribute to variations in certain components of nicotine dependence between adult and adolescent female mice. Furthermore, this implies that smoking cessation therapies may not be equally effective across all ages.

Using a dual-dependency perspective this study presents results from 26 in-depth interviews with international secondees within two UK-based organizational contexts. The paper explores the perceived impact of an IA on the career capital of individuals, showing that the outcomes of IAs can be equivocal for expatriates. Each firm concentrated their human resource mechanisms on developing different types of career capital and this focused individual behaviour on diverse career capital activities. In one of the organizations there was an internal misalignment between organizational and individual assignee focus. Based on the research a number of propositions were developed. This study provided an exploratory insight into points of departure rather than complementarity in individuals' international careers in organizations, which has been at the core of much recent research and writing. A more complex, contextualized picture of the effects of IAs on the careers of individuals emerged.

It uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to further our understanding of how important a variety of items are in the decision to work abroad. Employing a mutual dependency perspective it contrasts individual motives and organizational perspectives. Organizations significantly underestimate the importance of career, work/life balance and development considerations and overestimate the financial imperative and some family motives. The analysis showed that for individuals some of these factors significantly relate to outcome variables in terms of the perceived career capital accrued from assignments.

W142, Baltimore, MD, US, 21224","Context: Due to the chronic nature of cocaine dependence, long-term maintenance treatments may be required to sustain abstinence. Abstinence reinforcement is among the most effective means of initiating cocaine abstinence. Practical and effective means of maintaining abstinence reinforcement programs over time are needed. Objective: To determine whether employment-based abstinence reinforcement can be an effective long-term maintenance intervention for cocaine dependence. Design: Participants (n = 128) were enrolled in a 6-month job skills training and abstinence initiation program. Participants who initiated abstinence, attended regularly and developed needed job skills during the first 6 months were hired as operators in a data entry business and assigned randomly to an employment-only (control, n = 24) or abstinence-contingent employment (n = 27) group. Setting: A non-profit data entry business. Participants Unemployed welfare recipients who used cocaine persistently while enrolled in methadone treatment in Baltimore. Intervention: Abstinence-contingent employment participants received 1 year of employment-based contingency management, in which access to employment was contingent upon provision of drug-free urine samples under routine and then random drug testing. If a participant provided drug-positive urine or failed to provide a mandatory sample, then that participant received a temporary reduction in pay and could not work until urinalysis confirmed recent abstinence. Main outcome measure: Cocaine-negative urine samples at monthly assessments across 1 year of employment. Results: During the 1 year of employment, abstinence-contingent employment participants provided significantly more cocaine-negative urine samples than employment-only participants [79.3% and 50.7%, respectively; P = 0.004, odds ratio (OR) = 3.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.60-8.69]. Conclusions: Employment-based abstinence reinforcement that includes random drug testing is effective as a long-term maintenance intervention, and is among the most promising treatments for drug dependence. Work-places could serve as therapeutic agents in the treatment of drug dependence by arranging long-term employment-based contingency management programs.

Genes encoding dopamine receptor subtypes are thus good candidate loci for understanding the genetic etiologies of susceptibility to alcohol dependence and its antecedent behavioral phenotypes. We tested whether variation in DRD1 influences alcohol consumption in rhesus macaques and whether its influence is mediated by sex and early rearing experience. We genotyped a single nucleotide polymorphism (<e2><88><92>111 G/T) in the 5'UTR of DRD1 in 96 subjects raised with their mothers until 6 months of age (n = 43) or in peer-only groups (n = 53). As young adults they underwent a 7-week voluntary ethanol consumption experiment. ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of sex (F1,95=6.3, P=0.014) and an interaction between genotype, sex and rearing on ethanol consumption (F7,95=4.63, P=0.0002). Maternally deprived males heterozygous for the T allele consumed significantly more ethanol (P >t <e2><89><a4>0.0001) than the other subgroups. Maternal deprivation can produce individuals that are anxious and impulsive, both of which are known risk factors for alcohol dependence. Our work demonstrates a potential role for the dopamine D1 receptor gene in modulating alcohol consumption, especially in the context of early environmental stress.

Purpose The aim was to study the mediating role of coping (i.e., active coping and emotional discharge) in the relationship between workaholism, ill-health (i.e., psychological distress and physical complaints), and job performance. Method A theory-based model was tested among 757 employees of a Japanese construction machinery company. Results Workaholism was positively related to active coping, which was, in its turn, negatively associated with ill-health and positively with job performance. Workaholism was also positively related to emotional discharge, which was positively associated with ill-health. In addition, workaholism was positively and directly related to ill-health, whereas it was not significantly related to job performance. Conclusion Workaholism is associated with both active coping and emotional discharge. Active coping leads to better health and performance, whereas emotional discharge leads to poor health. In addition, workaholism coincides with poor health. Since the costs for workaholics themselves (in terms of ill-health) are high, workaholism has on average adverse effects on health and performance.

Most research in this area has focused on the negative consequences of workaholism, specifically work-life imbalance. One area of research that has largely been ignored is the potential influence of demographic variables on the relationship between workaholism and work-life imbalance. Therefore, the current study focused on how cultural origin might influence the intensity of this relationship. Based on relative deprivation theory and previous empirical work, it was expected that cultural origin would moderate the relationship between workaholism and work-life imbalance. Specifically, it was predicted that Caucasian participants would score higher on levels of workaholism than Black participants, and that the relationship between workaholism and work-life imbalance would be stronger for Caucasians than for Blacks. The results revealed that high levels of workaholism were significantly correlated with high levels of work-life imbalance. However, results also indicated that cultural origin did not moderate the relationship between workaholism and work-life imbalance, and there was no significant mean difference between Caucasian and Black participants on our measure of workaholism. These findings are important in that it is essential for employers to be aware of workaholic tendencies so they can better handle the negative consequences that result for the organization, and to also help promote the well-being of their employees.

Methods: Survey data were collected from 1086 transit workers. Participants reported hours worked per week, food choices, leisure-time physical activity and perceptions of the work environment with regard to healthy eating. Height and weight were measured for each participant. Multivariate linear and logistic regressions were conducted to examine associations between work hours and behavioral variables. Associations were examined in the full sample and stratified by gender. Results: Transit workers working in the highest work hour categories had higher BMI and poorer dietary habits, with results differing by gender. Working 50 or more hours per week was associated with higher BMI among men but not women. Additionally, working 50 or more hours per week was significantly associated with higher frequency of accessing cold beverage, cold food, and snack vending machines among men. Working 40 or more hours per week was associated with higher frequency of accessing cold food vending machines among women. Reported frequency of fruit and vegetable intake was highest among women working 50 or more hours per week. Intake of sweets, sugar sweetened beverages, and fast food did not vary with work hours in men or women. Physical activity and perception of ease of eating healthy at work were not associated with work hours in men or women. Conclusions: Long work hours were associated with more frequent use of garage vending machines and higher BMI in transit workers, with associations found primarily among men. Long work hours may increase dependence upon food availability at the worksite, which highlights the importance of availability of healthy food choices.

Women were assessed at 13<e2><80><93>14 weeks (T1), 21<e2><80><93>22 weeks (T2), and 32<e2><80><93>33 weeks (T3) of gestation with measures of distress and anxiety (the K10, Perceived Stress Scale, and the State Subscale of the Spielberger State<e2><80><93>Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI]) and with uterine Doppler flow velocity studies. The Trait Subscale of the STAI was done either at T1 or T2. Thirty women were seen at T1, 79 women were seen at T2, and 59 women were seen at T3. No significant correlations were found between measures of distress and anxiety and umbilical artery pulsatility index (PI) or middle cerebral artery PI at any time-point. Small positive correlations between trait anxiety and uterine artery PI were found, but these were not significant after adjustment for alcohol and nicotine use (any use as well as problem drinking/nicotine dependence). At T3 but not T1 or T2, women scoring above 20 on the K10 (a standardized cutoff for the presence of axis I psychiatric disorders) had higher uterine artery PI than those scoring below 20. This was significant after adjusting for alcohol and nicotine use, as well as when nicotine dependence was considered. This work highlights the complexities of the relationship between increased measures of distress and anxiety and changes in the placental circulation. Further work in this area is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms which account for this relationship and to delineate fully the extent to which the relationship is determined by the presence of psychiatric and substance use disorders.

Drawings on Self-Determination Theory, both autonomous and controlled motivation were suggested to drive excessive work, which therefore was expected to relate positively to both well-being (i.e. vigor) and ill-health (i.e. exhaustion). Compulsive work, in contrast, was hypothesised to originate exclusively out of controlled motivation and therefore to only associate positively with ill-being. Structural equation modeling in a heterogeneous sample of Belgian white-collar workers (N = 370) confirmed that autonomous motivation associated positively with excessive work, which then related positively to vigor. Controlled motivation correlated positively with compulsive work, which therefore related positively with exhaustion. The hypothesised path from controlled motivation to exhaustion through excessive work was not corroborated. In general, the findings suggest that primarily compulsive work yields associations with ill-being, since it may stem from a qualitatively inferior type of motivation.

The mood as input model might offer an explanation for the difference in work persistence of these employees. This model suggests that the interplay of mood and 'persistence rules' (enough and enjoyment rules) may lead to different kinds of persistence mechanisms. Purpose: The aims of this study are to present a scale for measuring persistence rules, the Work Persistence rules Checklist (WoPeC), to analyze its psychometric properties and to test the mood as input model in relationship with workaholism and work engagement. Method: Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Results: Results of a confirmatory factor analysis in study 1 provided support for the hypothesized factor structure of the WoPeC. In study 2, it appeared that the use of an enough and an enjoyment rule for determining when to continue working is related to workaholism and work engagement, respectively. Furthermore, it was hypothesized and found that negative mood is related to workaholism, whereas positive mood is associated with work engagement. The expected interactions between mood and persistence rules on workaholism and work engagement were not demonstrated. Conclusion: Mood and persistence rules seem relevant for explaining the difference between workaholism and work engagement.

A confirmatory factor analysis showed that workaholism and work engagement were two largely independent concepts. Crossing these two concepts yielded four types of workers: workaholic employees, engaged employees, engaged workaholics, and nonworkaholic/nonengaged employees. MANOVA and subsequent ANOVAs were used to compare these four groups regarding their motivation, working hours, and levels of burnout. As expected, study results revealed that workaholic employees were driven by controlled motivation, whereas engaged employees were driven by autonomous motivation. Engaged workaholics were driven by both controlled and autonomous motivation. In addition, the results revealed that engaged workaholics spent most time on working. Unlike workaholic employees, engaged workaholics did not experience the highest levels of burnout, suggesting that high engagement may buffer the adverse consequences of workaholism.

This study aims to extend previous work on the relationship between obsessions and compulsions by specifically including mental compulsions and reassurance-seeking. Because these compulsions have traditionally been omitted from prior factor analytic studies, their association to what have been called <e2><80><98><e2><80><98>pure obsessions<e2><80><99><e2><80><99> may have been overlooked. Method: Participants (N = 201) were recruited from two multi-site randomized clinical treatment trials for OCD. The YBOCS-SC was used to assess OCD symptoms, as it includes a comprehensive list of obsessions and compulsions, arranged by content category. Each category was given a score based on whether symptoms were present and if the symptom was a primary target of clinical concern, and a factor analysis was conducted. Mental compulsions and reassurance-seeking were considered separate categories for the analysis. Results: Using an orthogonal geomin rotation of 16 YBOCS-SC categories/items, we found a five-factor solution that explained 67% of the total variance. Inspection of items that composed each factor suggests five familiar constructs, with mental compulsions and reassurance-seeking included with sexual, aggressive, and religious obsessions (unacceptable/taboo thoughts). Conclusions: This study suggests that the concept of the <e2><80><98><e2><80><98>pure obsessional<e2><80><99><e2><80><99> (e.g., patients with unacceptable/taboo thoughts yet no compulsions) may be a misnomer, as these obsessions were factorially associated with mental compulsions and reassurance-seeking in these samples. These findings may have implications for DSM-5 diagnostic criteria.

CB was more common among younger (<18 years old) students. The scores of all of these scales were significantly correlated. The strong correlation among different addictive behaviours is in line with the hypothesis of a common psychopathological dimension underlying these phenomena.

Among male populations, substance dependence is associated with aggression and criminal behavior. Individuals with ASPD have more severe substance dependence, including higher symptom counts, earlier age of onset, and more frequent co-morbidity. Incarcerated women have a high prevalence of ASPD and substance dependence, but there has been little detailed work regarding addiction severity. Similarly, work on association of substance abuse and dependence with specific violent behaviors has been limited. This study examined a group of 41 mid-sentence female felons with a diagnosis of ASPD to determine associations with substance abuse and dependence. Data were gathered through administration of the Semi-Structured Assessment of the Genetics of Alcoholism II (SSAGA II). Substance dependence was highly prevalent (i.e., alcohol dependence, 56.1%; opiate dependence, 48.8%; cocaine dependence, 61.0%). While specific diagnoses were not associated with violent behavior and offending, symptom severity (i.e., age of onset, symptom count, co-morbidity) was associated with violent behavior in women dependent on opiates, alcohol, and cocaine. Arrest for an assault 1 was associated with alcohol dependence and opiate dependence. These data suggest that measurement of symptom severity and co-morbidity is important in assessing violent behavior in incarcerated women with ASPD. These findings are potentially important in examining non-incarcerated, substance-dependent women.

Empirical evidence from the Indonesian Family Life Survey,Harm Reduct J,2011,8,NA,NA,BioMed Central Limited,1477-7517,"Hidayat, Budi","Background: Indonesia is one of the largest consumers of tobacco in the world, however there has been little work done on the economics addiction of tobacco. This study provides an empirical test of a rational addiction (henceforth RA) hypothesis of cigarette demand in Indonesia. Methods: Four estimators (OLS, 2SLS, GMM, and System-GMM) were explored to test the RA hypothesis. The author adopted several diagnostics tests to select the best estimator to overcome econometric problems faced in presence of the past and future cigarette consumption (suspected endogenous variables). A short-run and long-run price elasticities of cigarettes demand was then calculated. The model was applied to individuals pooled data derived from three-waves a panel of the Indonesian Family Life Survey spanning the period 1993-2000. Results: The past cigarette consumption coefficients turned out to be a positive with a p-value < 1%, implying that cigarettes indeed an addictive goods. The rational addiction hypothesis was rejected in favour of myopic ones. The short-run cigarette price elasticity for male and female was estimated to be -0.38 and -0.57, respectively, and the long-run one was -0.4 and -3.85, respectively. Conclusions: Health policymakers should redesign current public health campaign against cigarette smoking in the country. Given the demand for cigarettes to be more prices sensitive for the long run (and female) than the short run (and male), an increase in the price of cigarettes could lead to a significant fall in cigarette consumption in the long run rather than as a constant source of government revenue.

Terms such as 'workaholism,' 'work addiction' and 'excessive work' have been used interchangeably. Given the increase in empirical research, this study presents the development of the Bergen Work Addiction Scale (BWAS), a new psychometrically validated scale for the assessment of work addiction. A pool of 14 items, with two reflecting each of seven core elements of addiction (i.e., salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict, relapse, and problems) was initially constructed. The items were then administered to two samples, one recruited by a web survey following a television broadcast about workaholism (n = 11,769) and one comprising participants in the second wave of a longitudinal internet-based survey about working life (n = 368). The items with the highest corrected item-total correlation from within each of the seven addiction elements were retained in the final scale. The assumed one-factor solution of the refined seven-item scale was acceptable (root mean square error of approximation = 0.077, Comparative Fit Index = 0.96, Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.95) and the internal reliability of the two samples were 0.84 and 0.80, respectively. The scores of the BWAS converged with scores on other workaholism scales, except for a Work Enjoyment subscale. A suggested cut-off for categorization of workaholics showed good discriminative ability in terms of working hours, leadership position, and subjective health complaints. It is concluded that the BWAS has good psychometric properties.

The empirical evidence, however, is not unequivocal, and some authors have suggested possible downsides of identification with the organization as a whole or with a group within it. The potential negative effect of over-identification was tested empirically for the first time in the present paper. Two studies were conducted; Study 1 was cross-sectional and used a sample of Italian law court clerks (N = 195) and Study 2 was longitudinal and employed a sample of Italian teachers (N = 140 at T2). We proposed a curvilinear mediation model with identification curvilinearly predicting workaholism, and workaholism, in turn, negatively affecting employee well-being. This curvilinear link between organizational identification and workaholism means that workaholism at first decreases with growing identification, but when identification becomes too strong, workaholism increases. The results confirmed our hypotheses, and we discuss theoretical and practical implications.

Surprisingly little is known about expectancies for caffeine even though it is the most widely used psychoactive drug in the world. In a series of independent studies, the nature and scope of caffeine expectancies among caffeine consumers and nonconsumers were assessed, and a comprehensive and psychometrically sound Caffeine Expectancy Questionnaire (CaffEQ) was developed. After 2 preliminary studies, the CaffEQ was administered to 1,046 individuals from the general population along with other measures of interest (e.g., caffeine use history, anxiety). Exploratory factor analysis of the CaffEQ yielded a 7-factor solution. Subsequently, an independent sample of 665 individuals completed the CaffEQ and other measures, and a subset (n = 440) completed the CaffEQ again approximately 2 weeks later. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed good model fit, and test<e2><80><93>retest reliability was very good. The frequency and quantity of caffeine use were associated with greater expectancies for withdrawal/dependence, energy/work enhancement, appetite suppression, social/mood enhancement, and physical performance enhancement and lower expectancies for anxiety/negative physical effects and sleep disturbance. Caffeine expectancies predicted various caffeine- associated features of substance dependence (e.g., use despite harm, withdrawal incidence and severity, perceived difficulty stopping use, tolerance). Expectancies for caffeine consumed via coffee were stronger than for caffeine consumed via soft drinks or tea. The CaffEQ should facilitate the advancement of our knowledge of caffeine and drug use in general.

Maladaptive personal attributes appear in the form of depression, anxiety, and interpersonal sensitivity. This study was designed to assess the prospective relationship between earlier maladaptive personal attributes (mean age = 40) and later nicotine dependence (X age=65.2) within an understudied female community sample. The participants were given self-administered questionnaires. The results supported a model by which earlier maladaptive personal attributes predicted later nicotine dependence through several indirect pathways. In addition to cigarette smoking, several domains mediated the relation of earlier maladaptive personal attributes and later nicotine dependence. These domains included internal factors (ie, later maladaptive personal attributes), interpersonal factors (ie, marital/partner conflict), later contextual factors (ie, family financial difficulty). Our multidimensional longitudinal findings have important implications for the prevention and treatment of nicotine dependence. The results identify earlier and later significant psychosocial risk factors to be targeted, and suggest the timing of interventions to reduce or eliminate nicotine dependence.

Survival sex work, very common among injection drug users, has been associated with poor Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) engagement, retention and response. Therefore, this study was undertaken to determine factors associated with engaging in sex work among long-term opioid dependent women receiving OAT. Methods: Data from a randomized controlled trial, the North American Opiate Medication Initiative (NAOMI), conducted in Vancouver and Montreal (Canada) between 2005-2008, was analyzed. The NAOMI study compared the effectiveness of oral methadone to injectable diacetylmorphine or injectable hydromorphone, the last two on a double blind basis, over 12 months. A research team, independent of the clinic services, obtained outcome evaluations at baseline and follow-up (3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months). Results: A total 53.6% of women reported engaging in sex work in at least one of the research visits. At treatment initiation, women who were younger and had fewer years of education were more likely to be engaged in sex work. The multivariate logistic generalized estimating equation regression analysis determined that psychological symptoms, and high illicit heroin and cocaine use correlated with women<e2><80><99>s involvement in sex work during the study period. Conclusions: After entering OAT, women using injection drugs and engaging in sex work represent a particularly vulnerable group showing poorer psychological health and a higher use of heroin and cocaine compared to women not engaging in sex work.

In this work, temperament and character features of individuals addicted to opiates or alcohol are compared with normal controls to study personality factors in the overall risk for drug addiction. Methods: The study was done in a permissive environment, with easy access to alcohol and heroin, which facilitated analyses of personality factors in drug choice. Participants included 412 consecutive patients (312 opiate addicts, 100 alcohol addicts) treated at the Specialized Hospital for Chemical Dependency in Belgrade, Serbia, and a community sample of 346 controls. Results: Opiate addicts manifested antisocial temperament configuration (high Novelty Seeking, low Reward Dependence) coupled with high Self-transcendence (ie, susceptibility to fantasy and imagination). Alcohol addicts manifested sensitive temperament configuration (high Novelty Seeking coexisting with high Harm Avoidance). Immature personality was observed far more frequently in opiate addicts than in alcoholics or normals. Conclusions: Novelty Seeking appears to be a general risk factor for drug addiction. High Harm Avoidance appears to channel individuals with high Novelty Seeking towards alcoholism. Immature character traits and probable Personality Disorder increase the risk of illegal drugs. Based on equivalent research in nonpermissive environments, at least a portion of our opiate addicts could have developed alcoholism instead in environments with more limited access to opiates. Personality factors provide useful guidelines for preventive work with young individuals with personality risk factors for drug addiction.

Materials and Methods: The study included 178 working people. The survey was conducted at three stages<e2><80><94>half a year before a holiday, right after the holiday and half a year after the holiday.

To test the mediating role of general and occupational stress, hierarchical regression analysis as well as the method of bootstrapping were applied. Results and Conclusions: Our results indicate that general stress is an important mediator of the relationship between workaholism recognized as an addiction and work-family conflicts. Occupational stress turned out to be the only mediator in the relationship between workaholism (recognized as an addiction) and the work-family conflict, noted exclusively in the first stage of the study.

The variable-centered analysis based on Structural Equadon Modelling revealed that the latent factors of work engagement and workaholism did not correlate with each other, thereby suggesting that they are independent constructs. The personcentered inspection with Growth Mixture Modelling indicated four work engagement-workaholism classes: 1) 'high decreasing WE - low stable WH' (18%), 2) 'low increasing WE - average decreasing WH' (7%), 3) 'low decreasing WE - low stable WH' (6%), and 4) 'high stable WE - average stable WH' (68%). Overall, these results suggest first that also at the intra-individual level work engagement and workaholism were largely independent psychological states (changes in work engagement and workaholism were related only in the class 'low increasing WE - average decreasing WH', 7%); second, job conditions had an impact on the levels of both work engagement and workaholism as, typically, the participants in the class 'low increasing WE - average decreasing WH' had typically changed their job during the study period. The fact that work engagement and workaholism are sensitive to job changes suggests that both psychological conditions depend - at least partly - on the individual's work situation.

This study examined workaholism<e2><80><99>s associations with psychological ill health, low back pain with disability, and sickness absence among Japanese workers. Methods: A cross-sectional Internet survey was conducted using self-administered questionnaires. Data from 3,899 Japanese workers were analyzed. Workaholism was measured using the Dutch Workaholism Scale (DUWAS). Scores were divided into tertiles, where respondents were classified into three groups (high, middle, and low). Depressive mood as a measure of psychological ill health was assessed using the SF-36 mental health subscale, and low back pain using a standardized question. Sickness absence, except that due to physical injuries, was categorized either as absence due to mental health problems or to physical/somatic problems including the common cold. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the association between workaholism and depressive mood, low back pain with disability, and sickness absence, adjusting for demographic characteristics, job demand, job control, and workplace support. Results: Compared to the low workaholism group, the middle and high workaholism groups had significantly higher odds for depressive mood (Odds ratio (OR) = 1.93 and 3.62 for the middle and high groups, respectively), disabling back pain (ORs = 1.36 and 1.77 for the middle and high groups, respectively). Workaholism was more strongly associated with sickness absence due to mental health problems than that for other reasons (ORs = 1.76 vs. 1.21 for the middle group and 3.52 vs. 1.37 for the high groups). Conclusions: Workaholism is significantly associated with poor psychological health, disabling back pain, and sickness absence, particularly from mental health problems. Therefore, workaholism must be considered when addressing wellbeing of workers.

A self-report questionnaire that included psychometrically-sound measures of the key constructs was completed by a sample of 139 employees. Correlation analyses, a hierarchical regression, and a structural equation model were conducted to test the proposed relations and mediating hypotheses. Adaptive perfectionism was found to be related to job engagement, whereas maladaptive perfectionism emerged associated to both safe- and non-safe attachment styles. Moreover, only one attachment style (non-safe) and one type of perfectionism (maladaptive) were found to be linked to workaholism. Managers should pay attention to employees characterized by a non-safe attachment style and perfectionist personalities. Efforts should be made to improve job engagement among employees and to enhance constructive workaholism.

There are important differences, however, but few researchers have investigated the distinction. In this study, I used the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model (Demerouti, Bakker, Nachreiner, & Schaufeli, 2001) to propose an integrative model to demonstrate their meoretical and empirical dissimilarity. I chose turnover intention (TT) and occupational citizenship behavior (OCB) to measure organizational outcomes. The results showed that job resources were positively related to work engagement and that job demands moderated die relationship between job resources and work engagement. In addition, job demands were positively related to workaholism and job resources moderated the relationship between job demands and workaholism. Finally, work engagement influenced TI negatively and OCB positively. However, although workaholism influenced OCB negatively, as expected, die negative influence of workaholism on TI was contrary to my hypothesis.

The patients self-rated humiliation by The Cantril Ladder, and 35% of the sample was defined as the high humiliation group. Results: Final multivariate analysis found significant associations between compulsory admission, not being in paid work, high scores on hostility, and on entitlement, and high levels of humiliation. No significant interactions were observed between these variables, and the narcissism score was not a confounder concerning humiliation. Conclusions: High level of humiliation during the admission process was mainly related to patient factors, but also to compulsory admission which should be avoided as much as possible protecting the self-esteem of the patients.

However, most current research addressing this question is conducted at the individual level or takes into account only simple economic aggregate indicators, such as unemployment rates or inflation. The effects of unemployment on life satisfaction however are likely to vary between societies depending on factors beyond the economic realm. This paper demonstrates the need to consider a wider set of country-level characteristics, including economic, demographic and attitudinal indicators, if the relationship between unemployment and life-satisfaction is to be understood adequately. Using data from the World Values Survey multi-level models are computed for up to 40 European and Anglo-Saxon societies. While economic indicators such as GDP per capita and income inequality appear to be relevant, unemployment rates seem to not affect the relationship greatly, contrary to results from several previous studies. Other factors however do, either mitigating the loss in life-satisfaction when becoming unemployed (such as the mean level of the perception of autonomy in a society), or further depressing life satisfaction (such as the mean emphasis of work in a society, the age-dependency ratio or the proportion of women in the labour force). Possible explanations are discussed and suggestions for improved further research made.

Since then, there have been many examples of how such involvement has been approached by education providers. Nevertheless, one of the key obstacles and challenges in this field continues to centre on the need to achieve non-tokenistic user involvement which cements the engagement of service users and carers at the heart of social work education. This paper describes one such initiative where service user and carer colleagues in a university in Northern Ireland have been actively involved in the assessment of first year social work students<e2><80><99> preparation for their first period of practice learning. The paper presents the background to this initiative explaining how the project unfolded; the detailed preparations that were involved and the evidence gathered from evaluations undertaken with the students, service users and carers, and academic colleagues who were all involved.

This article will provide an overview of the development of rtfMRI and discussion of its potential uses in the treatment of addictions. We also describe a series of pilot studies that highlight some of the technical challenges in developing a rtfMRI feedback paradigm for use in addictions, specifically in nicotine dependence. Because the use of rtfMRI feedback is in its infancy, the work described is focused on establishing some of the basic parameters in optimizing the rtfMRI feedback, such as the type of feedback signal, region of interest for feedback and predicting which subjects are most likely to respond well to training.

Previous work indicates that nicotine enhances responding for a conditioned reinforcer (CR). Objectives: These studies examined the effects of prior exposure to nicotine on responding for a CR, persistence of this response, and the role of <ce><b1>4<ce><b2>2 or <ce><b1>7 nicotinic receptor subtypes. Methods: Water deprived rats were given 13 Pavlovian conditioning sessions where a light/tone conditioned stimulus (CS) was paired with the delivery of water. Then, rats were presented with two levers: one delivered the CS (now a CR), the other was inactive. Experiments examined the effect of nicotine administered prior to Pavlovian conditioning sessions on approach behavior during CS presentations, operant responding for CR in the presence and absence of nicotine, and the persistence of responding for CR. The effects of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonism with mecamylamine and <ce><b1>4<ce><b2>2 or <ce><b1>7 nAChR antagonism with dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DH<ce><b2>E) or methyllycaconitine (MLA) on nicotine-enhanced responding for CR were examined. Results: Nicotine enhanced approach behavior during CS presentations and potentiated operant responding for CR, an effect sensitized as a result of nicotine exposure during conditioning. Responding for CR and its potentiation by nicotine was stable over multiple tests. Enhanced responding for the CR induced by nicotine was blocked by mecamylamine and DH<ce><b2>E, but not MLA. Conclusions: Nicotine enhances Pavlovian discriminated approach and shows sensitized nicotine-induced enhancements in responding for CR, an effect depending on <ce><b1>4<ce><b2>2 nAChRs.

Therefore, we characterize drug addiction stigma from multiple sources using qualitative methodology to advance understandings of how drug addiction stigma is experienced among methadone maintenance therapy patients and from whom. Results demonstrate that methadone maintenance therapy patients experience prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination from friends and family, coworkers and employers, healthcare workers, and others.

Prior work from our laboratory suggests, however, that adolescent male rats are actually less sensitive than adults to some enduring effects of heroin self-administration. In the present study, we tested two likely correlates of sensitivity to behavioral reinforcement in rats: physical withdrawal and locomotor sensitization. Methods: Adolescent (35 days old at start) and adult (79 days old) male Sprague<e2><80><93>Dawley rats were administered escalating doses of heroin, increasing from 1.0 to 8.0 mg/kg (i.p.) every 12 h, across 13 days. Somatic signs of spontaneous withdrawal were scored 12 and 24 h after the last injection, and then every 24 h for 5 days; locomotion was recorded concurrently. Challenge injections of heroin (1 mg/kgi.p.) were given at four points: as the first of the escalating doses (day 1), at days 7 and 13 during the escalating regimen, and after 12 days of forced abstinence. Body mass and food intake were measured throughout experimentation. Results: A heroin withdrawal syndrome was not observed among adolescents as it was among adults, including somatic signs as well as reduced locomotion, body mass, and food intake. On the other hand, heroin-induced locomotor sensitization did not differ across ages. Conclusion: Reduced withdrawal is consistent with the attenuated reinforcing effects of heroin among adolescent male rats that we reported previously. Thus, it is possible that adolescent rats could reveal important neuroprotective factors for use in treatment of heroin dependence.

The present study explores whether the interaction between the perception of an overwork climate in the workplace and person characteristics (i.e., achievement motivation, perfectionism, conscientiousness, self-efficacy) may foster workaholism. Data were collected on a sample of 333 Dutch employees. The results of moderated regression analyses fully supported our hypotheses and showed that the interaction between an overwork climate and person characteristics is related to workaholism. More specifically, our results revealed a significant increase in workaholism when employees both possessed person characteristics that predispose them toward workaholism and perceived an overwork climate in their workplaces. In addition, conscientiousness and self-efficacy were related to workaholism, but only in interaction with the presence of an overwork climate. These results contribute to the ongoing conceptualization of workaholism by demonstrating empirically that a work environment characterized by an overwork climate may foster workaholism, especially for those high in achievement motivation, perfectionism, conscientiousness, and self-efficacy.

Purpose: The present study aimed to demonstrate the prospective association of workaholism(i.e., working excessively hard in a compulsive fashion) with sleep quality among Japanese employees. Methods: A Web-based prospective survey was conducted in October 2010 and May 2011 among registered monitors of a survey company. The questionnaire included workaholism, sleep quality, job characteristics, and demographics. Overall, 13,564 monitors were randomly invited to complete the first wave of the survey. The first 2,520 respondents were included in this study. The respondents who completed the first wave were invited to complete the second wave of the survey; 2,061 answered. A total of 364 respondents who changed their working conditions during the follow-up period were excluded. In addition, due to missing values, data from 14 respondents were excluded. Thus, the responses from 1,683 respondents were included in the analysis (859 males and 824 females). An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted to compare adjusted sleep quality at follow-up among workaholism groups (low, middle, and high). To conduct the ANCOVA, we adjusted for demographics, sleep quality at baseline, and job characteristics. Results: The high-workaholic group had significantly longer sleep latency at follow-up compared with the low- and middle-workaholic groups after adjusting for demographics, sleep latency at baseline, and job characteristics. In addition, the high-workaholic group demonstrated significantly higher levels of daytime dysfunction compared with the low-workaholic group. However, no significant differences were found among workaholic groups in terms of overall sleep quality, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, and use of sleep medication. Conclusion: Workaholism was associated with poor sleep quality at the 7-month follow-up in terms of sleep latency and daytime dysfunction.

Widiger and colleagues, however, have argued that maladaptive behavior exists at both ends of trait continua. We propose that the role of evaluative variance differentiates these two perspectives and that once evaluation is isolated, maladaptive behaviors emerge at both ends of nonevaluative trait dimensions. In Study 1, we argue that evaluative variance is worthwhile to measure separately from descriptive content because it clusters items by valence regardless of content (e.g., lazy and workaholic; apathetic and anxious; gullible and paranoid; timid and hostile, etc.), which is unlikely to describe a consistent behavioral style. We isolate evaluation statistically (Study 2) and at the time of measurement (Study 3) to show that factors unrelated to valence evidence maladaptive behavior at both ends. We argue that nonevaluative factors, which display maladaptive behavior at both ends of continua, may better approximate ways in which individuals actually behave.

A factorial survey was conducted among 489 social workers, therapists, nurses, doctors and executives from 77 addiction care units in the three largest Swedish counties. Staff assessed the severity of 10 fictive scenarios, vignettes (n = 4724), describing persons with varying social characteristics who were users of alcohol, cannabis or cocaine. The effects of user, respondent and work-unit variables on the practitioners<e2><80><99> severity assessments were estimated using multilevel regression analysis. The results show that perceived severity was influenced not only by the substance, the frequency and character of the negative consequences of the use, but also by the age, socio-economic status and family situation of the user. Women, older respondents and respondents with a medical education rather than a social work education were on average more inclined to assess the vignettes as being more severe. Analyses of various interactions revealed that practitioners viewed the drinking of young men as being less severe than that of young women. Doctors saw women's use as more problematic than men's, irrespective of the context. To conclude, alcohol and drug consumption is judged by different norms, depending on various characteristics of the users, of the practitioners and also of their workplaces. To avoid potential negative consequences of the application of such varying standards in addiction care, more individual reflection and workgroup discussion are needed.

Study 2 was cross-lagged and applied confirmatory factor analyses, as well as hierarchical linear modeling to test discriminant, convergent, and predictive validity of harmonious and obsessive passion for work. Predictive validity was supported for obsessive and harmonious passion with respect to wellbeing, but not with respect to performance. When controlling for work engagement and workaholism, harmonious passion was negatively related to burnout and positively related to life satisfaction. In contrast, obsessive passion related positively to burnout and negatively to life satisfaction.

Based on a previous cross-sectional study by Shimazu and Schaufeli (Ind Health 47:495<e2><80><93>502, 2009) and a shorter term longitudinal study by Shimazu et al. (Ind Health 50:316<e2><80><93>21, 2012; measurement interval = 7 months), we predicted that workaholism predicts long-term future unwell-being (i.e., high ill-health and low life satisfaction) and poor job performance, whereas work engagement predicts future well-being (i.e., low ill-health and high life satisfaction) and superior job performance. Method: A two-wave survey was conducted among employees from one Japanese company, and valid data from 1,196 employees was analyzed using structural equation modeling. T1<e2><80><93>T2 changes in ill-health, life satisfaction, and job performance were measured as residual scores, which were included in the structural equation model. Results: Workaholism and work engagement were weakly and positively related to each other. In addition, and as expected, workaholism was related to an increase in ill-health and to a decrease in life satisfaction. In contrast, and also as expected, work engagement was related to increases in both life satisfaction and job performance and to a decrease in ill-health. Conclusion: Although workaholism and work engagement are weakly positively related, they constitute two different concepts. More specifically, workaholism has negative consequences across an extended period of 2 years, whereas work engagement has positive consequences in terms of well-being and performance. Hence, workaholism should be prevented and work engagement should be stimulated.

It is not clear, however, how increases in confidence in ability to refrain from use get translated into actual improvements in drug-related outcomes. Marlatt, among others, viewed the acquisition and use of coping skills as the key to behavior change, and self-efficacy as a cognitive state that enabled coping. But that model of behavior change has not been supported, and few studies have shown that the effects of self-efficacy are mediated by coping or by other processes. The current study combined 3 marijuana treatment trials comprising 901 patients to examine the relationships between self-efficacy, coping, and potential mediators, to determine if the effects of self-efficacy on outcomes could be explained. Results of multilevel models indicated that self-efficacy was a strong predictor of adaptive outcomes in all trials, even when no active treatment was provided. Tests of mediation showed that effects of self-efficacy on marijuana use and on marijuana-related problems were partially mediated by use of coping skills and by reductions in emotional distress, but that direct effects of self-efficacy remained largely unexplained. The results are seen as supportive of efforts to improve coping skills and reduce distress in marijuana treatment, but also suggest that additional research is required to discover what is actually occurring when substance use changes, and how self-efficacy enables those changes.

In recent years, kratom and its major alkaloid, mitragynine, spread worldwide with largely unknown effects on behavior and mental health. Recent studies show that kratom use can lead to dependence and that mitragynine works as an addictive drug in animal studies. Nevertheless, kratom preparations were also suggested as a less harmful substitute in opiate withdrawal. Potential side-effects of prolonged kratom use, however, are currently unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the social functioning of regular kratom users in Malaysia. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in three northern states of Peninsular Malaysia investigating 293 regular kratom consumers using the Addiction Severity Index in a snowball sampling technique. Findings showed that regular kratom users do not experience major impairments in their social functioning, despite being dependent on kratom for prolonged periods.

Despite longstanding calls for greater understanding of mixed opinions, existing evidence is inconclusive regarding effects of WOM dispersion, and theoretical accounts have relied primarily on the notion of reference dependence. Extending prior work, this research proposes an attribution-based account, in which consumer interpretation of WOM dispersion depends on the extent to which tastes in a product domain are perceived to be dissimilar, so that dispersion can be attributed to inconsistency in reviewer preferences rather than the product itself. Across four experimental studies, participants presented with online rating distributions were more tolerant of dispersion in taste-dissimilar product domains than taste-similar product domains, and the difference was driven by underlying attributions. Together, these findings expand current understanding of WOM, social distributions, and risk perception, by revealing distinct pathways through which consumers respond to differences of opinion. In addition, they suggest the opportunity to proactively influence the manner in which dispersion is perceived, highlighting its positive connotations while diminishing its association with risk.

Subjects with gambling disorder (N = 16) free from current psychotropic medication or psychiatric comorbidities, and healthy controls (N = 17), were entered into the study and undertook magnetic resonance imaging (3T MRI). Cortical thickness was quantified using automated segmentation techniques (FreeSurfer), and group differences were identified using permutation cluster analysis, with stringent correction for multiple comparisons. Gambling disorder was associated with significant reductions (average 15.8<e2><80><93>19.9 %) in cortical thickness, versus controls, predominantly in right frontal cortical regions. Pronounced right frontal morphometric brain abnormalities occur in gambling disorder, supporting neurobiological overlap with substance disorders and its recent reclassification as a behavioral addiction.

Over the past decades, an increasing number of genes potentially involved in nicotine addiction have been identified by different technical approaches. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying nicotine addiction remain largely unclear. Under such situation, a comprehensive analysis focusing on the overall functional characteristics of these genes, as well as how they interact with each other will provide us valuable information to understand nicotine addiction. In this study, we presented a systematic analysis on nicotine addiction-related genes to identify the major underlying biological themes. Functional analysis revealed that biological processes and biochemical pathways related to neurodevelopment, immune system and metabolism were significantly enriched in the nicotine addiction-related genes. By extracting the nicotine addiction- specific subnetwork, a number of novel genes associated with addiction were identified. Moreover, we constructed a schematic molecular network for nicotine addiction via integrating the pathways and network, providing an intuitional view to understand the development of nicotine addiction. Pathway and network analysis indicated that the biological processes related to nicotine addiction were complex. Results from our work may have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying nicotine addiction.

However, the BWAS has never been investigated in Eastern-European countries. The goal of the present study was to examine the factor structure, the reliability and cut-off scores of the BWAS in a comprehensive Hungarian sample. This study is a direct extension of the original validation of BWAS by providing results on the basis of representative data and the development of appropriate cut-off scores. The study utilized an online questionnaire with a Hungarian representative sample including 500 respondents (F = 251; Mage = 35.05 years) who completed the BWAS. A series of confirmatory factor analyses were carried out leading to a short, 7-item first-order factor structure and a longer 14-item seven-factor nested structure. Despite the good validity of the longer version, its reliability was not as high as it could have been. One-fifth (20.6 %) of the Hungarians who used the internet at least weekly were categorized as work addicts using the BWAS. It is recommended that researchers use the original seven items from the Norwegian scale in order to facilitate and stimulate cross-national research on addiction to work.

Conclusions: Workaholism can, in fact, be predicted through certain variables (personality, engagement, self-efficacy, ICO, satisfaction with life and lifestyle) and hence, the present study contributes to a better understanding of workaholism and to furthering a healthy life style which may be affected by workaholism.

Four types of worker (i.e. workaholics, positive workers, compulsive workers and hard workers) were distinguished, and their health indicators were compared. The results showed that workaholics experienced significantly more sleep problems (i.e. morning tiredness, sleeping while driving and sleeping fewer hours both on weekdays and at weekends, with poorer quality), had higher relative risk scores, and consumed more caffeine and alcohol than the other patterns of worker (positive, compulsive and hard workers). Further analyses revealed that sleep problems fully mediated the relationship between workaholism (i.e. working excessively and compulsively) and cardiovascular risk.

Design: We hypothesized that job demands would be positively related to workaholism, particularly when job resources are low. In addition, we hypothesized that workaholism would be positively related to negative outcomes in three important life domains: health, family, and work. Methods: The research involved 617 Italian workers (employees and self-employed). To test the hypotheses we applied structural equation modeling (SEM) and moderated structural equation modeling (MSEM) using Mplus 6. Results: The results of SEM showed a good model where workload, cognitive demands, emotional demands, and customer-related social stressors were positively related to workaholism and work<e2><80><93>family conflict (WFC) (partial mediation). Additionally, workaholism was indirectly related to exhaustion and intentions to change jobs through WFC. Moreover, MSEM analyses confirmed that job resources (job security and opportunities for development) buffered the relationship between job demands and workaholism. Particularly, the interaction effects were statistically significant in five out of eight combinations. Conclusions: These findings suggest that workaholism is a function of a suboptimal work environment and predicts unfavorable employee outcomes. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

It has been suggested that sex work may reflect manifestations of impulsive-antisocial psychopathic traits (e.g., reckless disregard, delinquency) in women more than men. The current work examined relative contributions of drug dependence and distinct psychopathic features in relation to traditional forms of sex work (i.e., prostitution) in women, along with gender differences in psychopathy relationships with casual forms of sex exchange (i.e., trading sex for necessities). Study 1 included 171 community-dwelling women offenders, and Study 2 included 319 participants (42.3% women) with histories of drug use and/or violence. Participants completed the Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version, prostitution was measured as self-report and/or public record data across studies, and sex exchange in Study 2 was assessed using a questionnaire based on prior research on sexual risk-taking. Findings across both studies demonstrated that although psychopathic traits, particularly impulsive-antisocial features, were associated with prostitution in women above the use of drugs, drug dependence did not moderate the relationship between psychopathic traits and prostitution in women. Analyses of Study 2 data revealed that impulsive-antisocial traits were associated with sex exchange at low, but not high, levels of interpersonal-affective traits across participants. As well, interpersonal-affective traits were significantly positively related to sex exchange in men and not significantly (and negatively) related in women. In sum, impulsive-antisocial traits related to prostitution among women, suggesting that women may manifest these traits within intimate contexts. Moreover, findings indicated gender differences in the manifestation of interpersonal-affective traits within sexual exchange contexts. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) General Scientific Summary<e2><80><94>This study supports the idea that women may manifest impulsive-antisocial psychopathic traits within intimate and gendered contexts, such as sex work and exchange. Findings suggest that impulsive-antisocial features of psychopathy are associated with traditional forms of sex work over and above drug dependence in adult women, and interpersonal-affective psychopathic traits exhibit differential relationships with more casual forms of indirect sex exchange in men and women, such that they are significantly positively associated with sex exchange in men and not significantly (and negatively) related in women.

Whereas, emerging work has shown that the pathophysiology of OCD might be related to more widely distributed large-scale brain systems including limbic system and the salience network. This study aims to investigate the aberrant spontaneous neuronal activity within the whole brain, and its association with the symptom severity for unmedicated OCD patients. Method: Twenty-eight unmedicated OCD adults and twenty-eight matched healthy controls were recruited for a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) analysis over whole brain was performed to examine the intrinsic cerebral activity of subjects. In addition, we conducted the voxel-based Pearson<e2><80><99>s correlative analysis to probe into the relationship between ALFF values and symptom severity for OCD patients. Results: Our results showed that OCD patients had increased ALFF measures in the left frontopolar cortex and left orbital frontal cortex (OFC), with decreased ALFF values in the right insula. Moreover, the right insular intrinsic activity was significantly correlated with total YBOCS score (r = 0.611, p = 0.002) and compulsion score (r = 0.640, p = 0.001) for OCD patients. Conclusion: The results showed abnormal intrinsic neuronal activity within CSTC circuit and salience network of OCD patients. Our finding of aberrant insular activity advanced the understanding of OCD pathophysiology beyond the traditional CSTC circuit. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first finding about a reduced insular activity at the resting state for unmedicated OCD patients, which might serve as an informative biomarker for OCD pathophysiology.

However, little is known about the delivery of parenting support for drug<e2><80><90>dependent parents, particularly within universal healthcare services. This study aimed to explore the way healthcare practitioners engage with this challenging agenda. Four multidisciplinary focus groups involving a purposive sample of 18 experienced healthcare professionals were conducted in Scotland. Participants included general practitioners, midwives, public health nurses and addiction staff who work together to provide care for vulnerable families. A focus group topic guide was developed to explore the views and experiences of these healthcare professionals in relation to providing parenting support for drug<e2><80><90>using parents, predominantly those receiving opioid substitution therapy. Data were analysed using a constant comparison method and thematic approach. The overarching narrative which united the focus group discussions was about the <e2><80><98>burden of care<e2><80><99> that these families pose for frontline healthcare professionals. Recurring themes centred on three key issues: the problematic nature of drug<e2><80><90>using parents themselves; clinical challenges in living up to the ideals of professional practice; and the wider context in which current practice is governed. Professionals expressed ambivalence over their parenting support role; anxiety over responsibility for intervening with this <e2><80><98>hard<e2><80><90>to<e2><80><90>engage<e2><80><99> population; and concern over <e2><80><98>dwindling<e2><80><99> resources and lack of organisational support. Nevertheless, strategies and opportunities for providing parenting support were acknowledged and there was consensus about the need for further skills training. Despite a proliferation of policy and good practice guidance on the delivery of parenting support for drug<e2><80><90>dependent parents, the findings of this study suggest that significant challenges remain. Notably, our findings raise questions about whose role it is to provide parenting support to drug<e2><80><90>using mothers and fathers, especially those who are not involved in the child protection system.

Higher ACE scores were significantly correlated with substance abuse scores and violence scores. Substance abuse and violence were also significantly correlated with each other. The violent offenders had significantly higher ACE and substance abuse scores than the nonviolent offenders. In a hierarchical logistic regression model, the ACE score and substance score both emerged as significant predictors of violence.

Method: In boys with FXS, the adaptive behaviours in six domains, including self<e2><80><90>dependence, locomotion, work skills, communication, socialisation and self<e2><80><90>management, were assessed by the Infants<e2><80><90>Junior Middle School Students Social<e2><80><90>life Abilities Scale. In addition, we compared the adaptive skills of boys with FXS to those of three control groups of boys, including boys with Down syndrome (DS) and typically developing (TD) boys matched by chronological age (CA) or mental age (MA). The profile of the adaptive behaviour of boys with FXS is discussed in detail. Results: Compared to boys with DS, boys with FXS obtained lower scores in three domains in adaptive behaviour, including work skills, socialisation and self<e2><80><90>management skills; boys with FXS had better scores in self<e2><80><90>dependence and locomotion skills than boys matched for MA; as expected, boys with FXS had significantly poorer adaptive skills in all six domains assessed compared to CA boys. Conclusion: The development of adaptive skills in boys with FXS was worse than that of boys with DS. The profile of the adaptive behaviour of boys with FXS establishes a basis for the development of targeted interventions to promote social development in this population.

This presentation seeks to examine the generalizability of findings using this measure among Russian and Spanish high school adolescents. Latent class analysis was used to explore addiction subgroups among adolescents in Russia (average age = 16.27; n = 715) and Spain (average age = 14.9; n = 811). Last 30-day prevalence of one or more of 11 addictions reviewed in the previous work was the primary focus (i.e., cigarettes, alcohol, hard drugs, eating, gambling, Internet, love, sex, exercise, work, and shopping) among Russian youth, and last-30 prevalence of one or more of 8 addictions among Spanish youth (the three drug use items had not been included in the questionnaire for these youths). Results confirmed a two-class model (addicted class and non-addicted class) among both Russian and Spanish adolescents. The mean number of addictions reported was 1.39 (SD = 1.78) addictions among Russian youth and 1.56 (SD = 1.68) addictions among Spanish youth. The prevalence of the sample that constituted the 'addicted group' in Russia and Spain was 32.2% and 28.6%, respectively. The most prevalent addictions (i.e., love, Internet, exercise) were similar. These results are similar to the findings previously reported for U.S. sample. Latent class structures for addictive behaviors are similar across international adolescent populations.

Methods: Our previous work with service users had generated 28 indicators of recovery. Using Delphi group methodology (three rounds), we assessed the extent to which stakeholders working in the addictions field agreed that the 28 indicators were important on a scale of 1<e2><80><93>10. Participants included 146 individuals with diverse job roles in 124 organisations across the British Isles. Findings: Round 1 scores were high. There was evidence of greater scoring consensus in Round 2, but this trend was less certain in Round 3. Participants scored 27/28 indicators <e2><89><a5> 7/10 in Round 3, so confirming their importance. The only Round 3 indicator with a mean score < 7 was 'experiencing cravings'. There were statistical differences between the Round 3 indicator scores of some sub-groups of participants, but absolute differences were small (never more than 1 point for any indicator). Conclusions: We have identified 27 recovery indicators that stakeholders working within the addiction field in the British Isles consistently ranked as important. Replicating our methods in other countries, and with additional stakeholder groups, will provide greater clarity on the term 'recovery', its relevance and value, and how it can best be measured.

This research also documents the relations between these workaholism profiles and a series of correlates (psychological need thwarting) and adaptive and maladaptive work outcomes. In addition, this research investigates the role of emotional dissonance and employees' perceptions of their workplaces' psychosocial safety climate (Study 1, n = 465), as well as job demands, resources, and perfectionism (Study 2, n = 780) in the prediction of profile membership. Latent profile analysis revealed four identical workaholism profiles in both studies. In Study 1, emotional dissonance predicted a higher likelihood of membership in the Very High, Moderately High, and Moderately Low profiles relative to the Very Low profile. In contrast, Study 2 revealed a more diversified pattern of predictions. In both studies, levels of need thwarting were the highest in the Very High and Moderately High profiles, followed by the Moderately Low profile, and finally by the Very Low profile. Finally, in both studies, the most desirable outcomes levels (e.g., lower levels of work<e2><80><93>family conflict and emotional exhaustion, and higher levels of perceived health) were associated with the Very Low profile, followed by the Moderately Low profile, then by the Moderately High profile, and finally by the Very High profile. Practitioner points The most desirable outcomes are associated with the profile characterized by the lowest levels of workaholism. Emotional dissonance predicts a lower likelihood of membership in the profile characterized by the lowest levels of workaholism. Levels of need thwarting are the lowest in the Very Low workaholism profile. High levels of socially prescribed perfectionism are associated with an increased likelihood of membership into the Very High workaholism profile. Reducing emotional dissonance, need thwarting, and socially prescribed perfectionism may help to reduce workaholism, in turn leading to more positive outcomes.

Using item response theory differential item functioning, we show women are less likely to report some workaholism items, leading to contamination. Specifically, women are less likely to report spending more time at work than other activities, and staying at work longer than others. We speculate that societal norms and practical restrictions on women's time results in lower endorsement rates for these items compared to men, and thus underestimates their workaholism.

They crave work for two main emotional incentives: to overcompensate low self-worth and to escape (i.e., reduce) negative affect, which is strategically achieved through neurotic perfectionism and compulsive working. Work-addicted individuals' strong persistence and self-discipline with respect to work-related activities suggest strong skills in volitional action control. However, their inability to disconnect from work implies low volitional skills. How can work-addicted individuals have poor and strong volitional skills at the same time? To answer this paradox, we elaborated on the relevance of two different volitional modes in work craving: self-regulation (self-maintenance) and self-control (goal maintenance). Four hypotheses were derived from Wojdylo's work craving theory and Kuhl's self-regulation theory: (H1) Work craving is associated with a combination of low self-regulation and high self-control. (H2) Work craving is associated with symptoms of psychological distress. (H3) Low self-regulation is associated with psychological distress symptoms. (H4) Work craving mediates the relationships between self-regulation deficits and psychological distress symptoms at high levels of self-control. Additionally, we aimed at supporting the discriminant validity of work craving with respect to work engagement by showing their different volitional underpinnings. Results of the two studies confirmed our hypotheses: whereas work craving was predicted by high self-control and low self-regulation and associated with higher psychological distress, work engagement was predicted by high self-regulation and high self-control and associated with lower symptoms of psychological distress. Furthermore, work styles mediated the relationship between volitional skills and symptoms of psychological distress. Based on these new insights, several suggestions for prevention and therapeutic interventions for work-addicted individuals are proposed.

More and more workers have a long-standing health problem or disability (LSHPD). The management of health needs and work demands is crucial for the quality of working life and work retention of these workers. However, no instrument exists measuring this process. The WHBq assesses key factors in the process of adjusting between health needs and work demands. Method: We tested the reliability and validity of 38 items with cross-sectional data from a sample of 321 Italian workers (mean age = 45 <c2><b1> 11 years) using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), Rasch analyses, and the correlations with other relevant variables. Results: The instrument ultimately consisted of 17 items that reliably measured three factors: work<e2><80><93>health incompatibility, health climate, and external support. These dimensions were associated with well-being in the workplace, dysfunctional behaviors at work, and general psychological health. A higher level on the WHB index was associated with lower levels of presenteeism, emotional exhaustion, workaholism, and psychological distress and with higher levels of job satisfaction and work engagement, supporting the construct validity of the instrument. Conclusion: The WHBq shows good psychometric characteristics and strong and theoretically consistent relationships with important and well-known variables. These results make the WHBq a promising tool in the study and management of health of employees, especially for the work continuation of employees returning to work with LSHPD.

Therefore, this study examined the association between low back pain, which interfered with work, and psychosocial factors in Japanese hospital workers. Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a hospital in Japan. In total, 280 hospital workers were recruited from various occupational settings. Of these, 203 completed a self-administered questionnaire that included items concerning individual characteristics, severity of low back pain, fear-avoidance beliefs (Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire), somatic symptoms (Somatic Symptom Scale-8), psychological distress (K6), workaholism, and work-related psychosocial factors (response rate: 72.5%). Logistic regression was used to explore risk factors associated with disabling low back pain. Results: Of the 203 participants who completed questionnaires, 36 (17.7%) reported low back pain that interfered with their work. Multivariate analyses with individual factors and occupations adjusted for showed statistically significant associations between disabling low back pain and fear-avoidance beliefs (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2.619, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.003 <c2><b1> 6.538], somatic symptoms (OR: 4.034, 95% CI: 1.819 <c2><b1> 9.337), and interpersonal stress at work (OR: 2.619, 95% CI: 1.067 <c2><b1> 6.224). Conclusions: Psychosocial factors, such as fear-avoidance beliefs, somatic symptoms, and interpersonal relationships at work, were important risk factors in low back pain that interfered with work in Japanese hospital workers.

In contrast, work design theory suggests asymmetry can lead to felt responsibility, but this link has not been tested and its theory remains underdeveloped. Drawing on self-determination theory (SDT), this article argues that work design characteristics can encourage the SDT internalization process<e2><80><94>the transformation of external reasons for behavior into internal reasons. Two experiments demonstrate asymmetry encourages felt responsibility for the dependent<e2><80><99>s task, which helps explain the amount of help provided to the dependent. The author proposes felt responsibility indicates the extent to which an external task has been internalized as a self-directed motivation.

However, 10<e2><80><93>23% of patients were estimated to have dropped out of treatment during the first 2 years. We evaluated dropout and factors associated with quitting treatment. Methods: We followed clients <e2><89><a5> 18 years old enrolled in five MMT clinics in Haiphong for 3 years. Persons who missed a consecutive month of methadone treatment were considered to have dropped out and were not allowed to return; those who missed greater than five consecutive doses were considered to be non-compliant but were allowed to restart treatment at their initial dose. Clients who dropped out or who were non-compliant during their third year of MMT (cases) were traced and matched with two clients who remained in treatment (controls) by gender, age, and length of time in the program. Cases and controls were interviewed. Additional data on levels of yearly retention were abstracted from clinic records. esults: Among the 1055 patients initially enrolled in MMT, dropout and non-compliance combined was 13.6% during the first year, 16.5% during the second year, and 22.3% during the third year. By 36 months, 33.3% of clients had dropped out, of whom 10.6% had died and 24% had been arrested. We traced and interviewed 81 clients who dropped out or who were non-compliant during year 3 as well as 161 controls. The primary reasons for dropping out included claiming no dependence on heroin (22.2%), conflict with work (21.0%), health problems (16.0%), and inability to afford the methadone co-payment of approximately 0.5 USD/day (14.8%). Independent factors associated with non-compliance included continuing to use heroin (aOR = 12.4, 95% CI 4.2<e2><80><93>36.8) and missing greater than three doses during the previous 3 months (aOR = 18.5, 95% CI 7.4<e2><80><93>47.1); receiving a daily dose of > 120 mg of methadone was associated with a lower odds ratio of dropping out (aOR = 0.3, 95% CI 0.1<e2><80><93>0.9). Conclusion: By 3 years, one third of all patients in treatment had permanently dropped out. Ensuring that methadone dosing is adequate and reducing or eliminating the co-payment fee for those who cannot afford it could improve retention.

The current study aimed to test the hypothesis that pain-related anxiety would predict early lapse and relapse to cigarette smoking. These data were collected in the context of a primary study examining the role of emotional vulnerabilities in smoking cessation. The current analyses were conducted among 55 daily cigarette smokers who attempted to quit without psychosocial or pharmacological cessation aids. Pain-related anxiety was assessed at baseline using the Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale-20 (PASS-20). Early lapse and relapse were assessed using timeline follow-back procedures. Cox regression analyses indicated that pain-related anxiety was a significant predictor of both early smoking lapse and relapse such that for every 1-point increase on the PASS-20, the risk of early lapse increased by 3.7% and the risk of early relapse increased by 3.6%. These effects were evident above and beyond the variance accounted for by tobacco dependence, past 4-week pain severity, anxiety sensitivity, and the presence of current Axis I psychopathology. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses further revealed that among early lapsers, greater pain-related anxiety predicted a more rapid trajectory to lapse. Pain-related anxiety was also a significant predictor of early lapse when the sample was limited to smokers with past 4-week pain. These findings lend empirical support to the notion that pain-related anxiety may contribute to the maintenance of tobacco dependence among smokers who experience varying levels of pain intensity.

Our previous work has indicated that current smokers show reduced performance on a probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) task, relative to former smokers. To further explore PRL performance and its relevance to smoking, in addition to the role of nicotine, we developed a model of nicotine withdrawal<e2><80><90>induced deficits in rodents. A second goal was to test varenicline, an <ce><b1>4<ce><b2>2 partial agonist, for its ability to restore any cognitive impairment. Acute effects of nicotine and varenicline on PRL performance in non<e2><80><90>dependent animals were minimal and confined to speed of responding. When rats were made dependent on nicotine via osmotic minipumps implanted for 7 days (3.16 mg/kg/day), repeated tests at specified withdrawal time points revealed PRL disruption peaking at 12 and 24 hours following surgical removal of minipumps. Withdrawal was characterized by significant deficits in the number of reversals (P < 0.05), speed of responding (P < 0.01) and increases in omissions (P < 0.05). Nicotine (0.2 mg/kg SC) or varenicline (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg SC) administered 10<e2><80><90>minute prior to PRL test sessions during withdrawal, relieved the performance deficits. At 24<e2><80><90>hour withdrawal, nicotine and varenicline (1 mg/kg) prevented decrements in reversals, in addition to ameliorating slower speed of responding. The high dose of varenicline only reduced omissions. These results confirm the role of nicotine in withdrawal<e2><80><90>induced disruption of PRL performance and suggest that the model may be useful for investigating efficacy of potential new treatments for smoking cessation.

Building on Dr. Markou<e2><80><99>s important work and that of others in the field, researchers at the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies have found that persistent changes in behavior following adolescent stress or alcohol exposure may be linked to induction of immune signaling in brain. Aim: This study aims to illuminate the critical interrelationship of the innate immune system (e.g., toll-like receptors [TLRs], high-mobility group box 1 [HMGB1]) in the neurobiology of addiction. Method: This study reviews the relevant research regarding the relationship between the innate immune system and addiction. Conclusion: Emerging evidence indicates that TLRs in brain, particularly those on microglia, respond to endogenous innate immune agonists such as HMGB1 and microRNAs (miRNAs). Multiple TLRs, HMGB1, and miRNAs are induced in the brain by stress, alcohol, and other drugs of abuse and are increased in the postmortem human alcoholic brain. Enhanced TLR-innate immune signaling in brain leads to epigenetic modifications, alterations in synaptic plasticity, and loss of neuronal cell populations, which contribute to cognitive and emotive dysfunctions. Addiction involves progressive stages of drug binges and intoxication, withdrawal-negative affect, and ultimately compulsive drug use and abuse. Toll-like receptor signaling within cortical-limbic circuits is modified by alcohol and stress in a manner consistent with promoting progression through the stages of addiction.

The present paper aimed to explore the predictive role of workaholism and self-concept in impostor feelings among employees. A sample of 317 employees (doctors, university teachers, lawyers, bankers, & nurses) from various organizations was approached through convenient sampling method for this research. Validated Urdu translated versions of Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (Clance, 1985), Dutch Workaholism Scale (Schaufeli, Shimazu, & Taris, 2009), and Six Factor Self-concept Scale (Stake, 1994) were administered along with a demographic sheet. Pearson Product-Moment correlation and step wise multiple regression was used to analyze the data. Results showed that negative self-concept is the most significant predictor for impostor feelings followed by workaholism.

Using a sample of 73 dyads composed of focal workers and their colleagues, the present study aimed: (1) to compare focal workers<e2><80><99> and coworkers<e2><80><99> perceptions concerning their levels of work engagement and workaholism; and (2) to explore the discriminant validity of engagement and workaholism.

Our results showed a considerable agreement between both raters (i.e., focal workers and coworkers) in levels of engagement and workaholism. In contrast to previous findings, a significant difference between raters on the cognitive dimension of workaholism (i.e., working compulsively) was observed.

Past research indicates that healthcare providers face significant challenges to their psychological wellbeing in the workplace. Objective: This study sought to determine the extent of these components in a sample of Canadian occupational therapists. Methods: An anonymous electronic survey including standardized measures of burnout, work engagement and work addiction. Results: Participants' scores at times differed from previous research on burnout in the occupational therapy profession in that they demonstrated higher depersonalization scores and lower emotional exhaustion scores. Relationships emerged among a number of elements within the various measures, and participants' age and years of experience. Scores indicating a risk of burnout and work addiction clustered at certain times across participants' years of experience, and scores for vigour were low in comparison to an international study of healthcare workers. However, scores in other elements were high (for example, dedication and personal accomplishment), which theorists propose may serve a protective role in mitigating high scores in negative elements. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate a risk for diminished work-related psychological health and point to key areas for further investigation around which targeted interventions could be organized for members of the occupational therapy profession.

Whereas mental health communities are divided about potentially problematic use patterns, many lay people identify as feeling dysregulated or compulsive in their use. Prior work has labeled this tendency perceived addiction to internet pornography (PA). This study's aims were to (1) assess the association between PA at baseline and other factors, including actual levels of average daily pornography use and personality factors and (2) assess the associations between baseline variables and PA 1 year later. Design: Two large<e2><80><90>scale community samples were assessed using online survey methods, with subsets of each sample being recruited for follow<e2><80><90>up surveys 1 year later. Setting: United States. Participants: Participants were adults who had used pornography within the past 6 months recruited in two samples. Sample 1 (n = 1507) involved undergraduate students from three US universities and sample 2 (n = 782) involved web<e2><80><90>using adults. Subsets of each sample (sample 1, n = 146; sample 2, n = 211) were surveyed again 1 year later. Measurements: At baseline, we assessed average daily pornography use, PA and relevant predictors (e.g. trait neuroticism, trait self<e2><80><90>control, trait entitlement, religiousness, moral disapproval of pornography use). One year later, we assessed PA. Findings: Cross<e2><80><90>sectionally, PA was correlated strongly with moral disapproval of pornography use [sample 1, Pearson's correlation: r = 0.68 (0.65, 0.70); sample 2, r = 0.58 (0.53, 0.63)]. Baseline moral disapproval [sample 1, r = 0.46 (0.33, 0.56); sample 2, r = 0.61 (0.51, 0.69)] and perceived addiction demonstrated relationships with perceived addiction 1 year later. We found inconclusive evidence of a substantial or significant association between pornography use and perceived addiction over time [sample 1, r = 0.13 (<e2><88><92>0.02, 0.28); sample 2, r = 0.11 (<e2><88><92>0.04, 0.25)]. Conclusions: Perceived addiction to internet pornography appears to be related strongly to moral scruples around pornography use, both concurrently and over time, rather than with the amount of daily pornography use itself.

At Time 1, we measured employee well-being, and 4 years later at Time 2, job crafting and well-being, using a large sample of Finnish dentists (N = 1,877). The results of structural equation modeling showed that (a) work engagement positively predicted both types of increasing resources and challenging demands and negatively predicted decreasing hindering demands; (b) workaholism positively predicted increasing structural resources and challenging demands; (c) burnout positively predicted decreasing hindering demands and negatively predicted increasing structural resources, whereas (d) job satisfaction did not relate to job crafting over time; and (e) work engagement positively influenced job satisfaction and negatively influenced burnout, whereas (f) workaholism predicted burnout after controlling for baseline levels. Thus, work engagement was a stronger predictor of future job crafting and other types of employee well-being than job satisfaction. Although workaholism was positively associated with job crafting, it also predicted burnout. We conclude that the relationship between job crafting and employee well-being may be more complex than assumed, because the way in which employees will craft their jobs in the future seems to depend on how they currently feel.

Using both self-report and informant measures, the study had the following four aims: (a) to examine the extent to which self-report and informant data correspond, (b) to investigate whether both self-report and informant measures of the alternative model of OCPD can predict traditional OCPD, (c) to determine if any traits additional to those proposed in the alternative model of OCPD can predict traditional OCPD, and (d) to investigate whether a measure of OCPD-specific impairment is better at predicting traditional OCPD than are measures of general impairment in personality functioning. A mental health sample of 214 participants was recruited and administered measures of both the traditional and alternative models of OCPD. Self-report data moderately corresponded with informant data, which is consistent with the literature. Results further confirmed rigid perfectionism as the core trait of OCPD. Perseveration and workaholism were also associated with OCPD. Hostility was identified as a trait deserving further research. A measure of OCPD-specific impairment demonstrated its ability to incrementally predict OCPD over general measures of impairment.

Most research in this field adheres to quantitative methodologies aligned to the addiction or trait paradigms and largely focuses on correlates and consequences of such behaviour. However, within this literature, empirically based understandings of the factors that propel individuals to engage in excessive work patterns are sparse. Resting on socio<e2><80><90>cultural theories of work, we adopt a novel approach to this field of enquiry and examine the genesis of excessive working using a qualitative methodology. We use discourse analysis to comparatively explore data from a sample of twenty<e2><80><90>eight workers comprising excessive and non<e2><80><90>excessive workers. Our study identified the roles of family of origin, educational experience, and professional norms as clear drivers of excessive work patterns.

We discuss our findings with reference to theories of workaholism and consider their implications for the evolution of this field.

The study examined the role of personality attributes (dependency, self-criticism), parental support, and reflectivity concerning own family of origin in making a smoother transition to mature romantic engagement. Greater achievement of romantic goals and greater mastery in balancing family and work demands were predicted by low dependency or low self-criticism (assessed at age 23) and a high level of reflectivity (assessed at age 29). The distinctive role of reflectivity with regard to own family script and personality attributes for a smoother romantic transition in adulthood is discussed.

In this work, we study recently active underage alcohol dependence as a susceptibility marker and estimate alcohol dependence-associated PPR rates of use, once use starts. In recent U.S. epidemiological samples, we identified 16,125 community-dwelling 12-to-20-year-olds with standardized assessments of both problem drinking and newly incident extra-medical PPR use. We applied zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regressions to estimate (a) alcohol dependence associations with susceptibility-to-persist after the very first occasion of extra-medical PPR use, and (b) the rate of PPR use, conditional on persistence. Underage drinkers with alcohol dependence were more susceptible to persistence in their extra-medical PPR use (p < .001). In addition, given susceptibility-to-persistence, there was an alcohol dependence-associated excess rate of extra-medical PPR use (risk ratio = 1.3; 95% confidence interval = 1.1, 1.6). Using ZIP regressions, we can see that underage alcohol dependence signals membership in a susceptible-to-persistence class of extra-medical PPR users and excess rates of extra-medical use. Underage drinking can be an indicator of greater vulnerability to start and persist in extra-medical use of PPR, particularly if presenting clinical features of alcohol dependence already are seen at or near time of first onset of such PPR use. For alcohol dependence-affected adolescent patients, nondrug pain management plans deserve consideration, with special surveillance if analgesic drugs are prescribed.

Even so, a substantial number of people report feeling that their use of pornography is dysregulated or out of control. Whereas prior works considered self-reported feelings of addiction via indirect scales or dimensional measures, the present work examined what might lead someone to specifically identify as a pornography addict. Consistent with prior research, pre-registered hypotheses predicted that religiousness, moral disapproval, and average daily pornography use would emerge as consistent predictors of self-identification as a pornography addict. Four samples, involving adult pornography users (Sample 1, N = 829, Mage = 33.3; SD = 9.4; Sample 2, N = 424, Mage = 33.6; SD = 9.1; Sample 4, N = 736, Mage = 48.0; SD = 15.8) and undergraduates (Sample 3, N = 231, Mage = 19.3; SD = 1.8), were collected. Across all three samples, male gender, moral incongruence, and average daily pornography use consistently emerged as predictors of self-identification as a pornography addict. In contrast to prior literature indicating that moral incongruence and religiousness are the best predictors of self-reported feelings of addiction (measured dimensionally), results from all four samples indicated that male gender and average daily pornography use were the most strongly associated with self-identification as a pornography addict, although moral incongruence consistently emerged as a robust and unique predictors of such self-identification.

Two major sources of GABAergic nerve terminals within the VTA are local VTA interneurons and neurons in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg). Here, using optogenetics, we compared synaptic properties of GABAergic synapses on VTA dopamine neurons using selective activation of afferents that originate from these two cell populations. We found little evidence of co<e2><80><90>release of glutamate from either input, but RMTg<e2><80><90>originating synaptic currents were reduced by strychnine, suggesting co<e2><80><90>release of glycine and GABA. VTA<e2><80><90>originating synapses displayed a lower initial release probability, and at higher frequency stimulation, short<e2><80><90>term depression was more marked in VTA<e2><80><90> but not RMTg<e2><80><90>originating synapses. We previously reported that nitric oxide (NO)<e2><80><90>induced potentiation of GABAergic synapses on VTA dopaminergic cells is lost after exposure to drugs of abuse or acute stress; in these experiments, multiple GABAergic afferents were simultaneously activated by electrical stimulation. Here we found that optogenetically<e2><80><90>activated VTA<e2><80><90>originating synapses on presumptive dopamine neurons also exhibited NO<e2><80><90>induced potentiation, whereas RMTg<e2><80><90>originating synapses did not. Despite providing a robust inhibitory input to the VTA, RMTg GABAergic synapses are most likely not those previously shown by our work to be persistently altered by addictive drugs and stress. Our work emphasises the idea that dopamine neuron excitability is controlled by diverse inhibitory inputs expected to exert varying degrees of inhibition and to participate differently in a range of behaviours.

This prediction has been tested for a variety of traits, particularly those under precopulatory sexual selection. However, few studies compare the condition dependence of a variety of phenotypic traits, potentially subject to different selective forces. Here we examine the condition dependence of several important life history traits, including those under both pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection, in the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor. We manipulated condition by randomly assigning larvae to one of high-, medium- or low-quality diets. For males reared on the three diets, we measured the following: (a) adult body size and lifespan, (b) pheromone attractiveness, (c) weight of their ejaculate transferred to females and (d) fecundity of their female mates. Males raised on a high-quality diet were larger and lived longer than males raised on medium- and low-quality diets. Although females were significantly attracted to male pheromones, there were no significant differences amongst condition treatments in male attractiveness nor ejaculate transfer. Furthermore, mates<e2><80><99> fecundity was also not affected by male condition. We discuss these results considering previous work on trade-offs and condition dependence of life history traits. Significance statement: Theory suggests that traits that are under strong selection should be sensitive to the amount of resources an organism has available (i.e. dependent on condition), such that when those resources are plentiful, then these traits should increase disproportionately to other traits that are not so important to relative fitness. Much research has been done on the condition dependence of precopulatory traits under strong sexual selection, but not as much on postcopulatory traits. Our research focused on measuring the effect of resources on both pre- and postcopulatory traits in male mealworm beetles as well as their effect on their mates<e2><80><99> relative fitness. Interestingly, although we found that important life history traits such as body size and adult lifespan were condition dependent, precopulatory traits such as pheromone attractiveness and postcopulatory traits such as ejaculate transfer were not. Our study highlights the complicated nature of tradeoffs in resource allocation faced by individuals under sexual selection.

Yet this is the reality for many employees in Europe. What are the mechanisms used by employees to assume this stability in the face of career norms that favor mobility? What is new in this research, with regard to the existing literature, is that it explains the career stability of employees in terms of identification mechanisms, in particular identification with the content of their work. Several results were obtained using the coding method to process the data collected in an association operating in the social sector. We began by distinguishing between four modalities of work content identification: normative, cognitive, emotive and performative. We went on to highlight two effects of work identification: the free will of agents, made possible by the argumentative resources they provide, and dependence on their work through the integration of structural constraints. Three types of arguments (factual, existential and normative) are identified which enable employees to adopt unique positions in relation to their career in the face of today<e2><80><99>s mobility norms: distantiation, conciliation and conformity. The process-based model proposed contributes to a dialectical reading of careers<e2><80><94>between structural and agentic effects<e2><80><94>emphasizing the social mechanisms used by employees to 'cope' with pressure to embrace career mobility.

Research has suggested that initiation of substances is both genetically and environmentally driven (Rhee et al., Archives of general psychiatry 60:1256<e2><80><93>1264, 2003; Verweij et al., Addiction 105:417<e2><80><93>430, 2010). A previous work has found a significant interaction between the polygenic score and the same elementary school-based intervention with tobacco smoking (Musci et al., in press). The polygenic score reflects the contribution of multiple genes and has been shown in prior research to be predictive of smoking cessation, tobacco use, and marijuana use (Uhl et al., Molecular Psychiatry 19:50<e2><80><93>54, 2014). Using data from a longitudinal preventive intervention study (N = 678), we examined age of first marijuana use from sixth grade to age 18. Genetic data were collected during emerging adulthood and were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 microarray (N = 545). The polygenic score was computed using these data. Discrete-time survival analysis was employed to test for intervention main and interaction effects with the polygenic score. We found main effect of the polygenic score approaching significance, with the participants with higher polygenic scores reporting their first smoking marijuana at an age significantly later than controls (p = .050). We also found a significant intervention <c3><97> polygenic score interaction effect at p = .003, with participants at the higher end of the polygenic score benefiting the most from the intervention in terms of delayed age of first use. These results suggest that genetics may play an important role in the age of first use of marijuana and that differences in genetics may account for the differential effectiveness of classroom-based interventions in delaying substance use experimentation.

Only few measures exist to identify work addiction and the health consequences are sparsely explored. The Bergen Workaholic Scale (BWAS) measures seven core elements of work addiction and has been used in Norway, Hungary, Brazil, Italy, USA and Poland. The aim of this study was to validate the BWAS in a Danish sample and to investigate if high risk of work addiction was associated with stress and reduced quality of life. We conducted an online screening survey with 671 participants aged 16<e2><80><93>68 years with the Danish translation of the BWAS. We added the perceived stress scale (PSS) and the quality of life scale EQ<e2><80><90>5D<e2><80><90>5L. Those with high risk of work addiction reported significantly higher mean PSS scores (20.0 points) compared to those with low risk of addiction (12.5 points) and poorer quality of life (61.9) compared to the low risk group (81.3). Furthermore, work addiction was associated with more weekly working hours (44.0 vs. 35.6 hours/week) and having more leadership responsibility. A preliminary estimate of work addiction prevalence was 6.6%. The BWAS demonstrated good reliability (<ce><b1> = 0.83), and factor analyses pointed at a single factor structure. Work addiction seems to be associated with health problems in terms of stress and poorer quality of life. The BWAS is recommended as a reliable and valid tool to identify work addiction in Danish.

Objective: We propose a new instrument for evaluating workaholism and work engagement, namely the Work-related Inventory (WI-10), which is based on Loscalzo and Giannini<e2><80><99>s (2017) comprehensive definition of workaholism. Methods: We developed a pool of 36 items, covering: 1) addiction symptoms; 2) obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and 3) work engagement. Then, we conducted Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor analyses on a sample of 503 Italian workers (165 males, 337 females, one missing; Mean age = 38.26 <c2><b1> 10.84) aiming to reduce the number of items. Results: The results showed a 10-items (2 filler) and 2-factor solution: 1) Workaholism and 2) Work Engagement; moreover, the WI-10 has good internal reliability, convergent and divergent validity. Conclusions: We found good psychometric properties for the WI-10. We also proposed the cut-off scores for the screening of the four kinds of workers proposed by Loscalzo and Giannini (2017): disengaged workaholics, engaged workaholics, engaged workers, and detached workers. The WI-10 will be useful for both research and preventive and clinical purposes.

Substance users<e2><80><99> compliance and treatment motivation are crucial for the effectiveness of treatment and rehabilitation programs. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between psychosocial variables and treatment motivation and to determine the effects of psychosocial variables, self-efficacy, and coping strategies on treatment motivation. Method: The study was conducted among 336 substance users taking part in a Cigarette, Alcohol and Drug Addiction Treatment Program (SAMBA) group program. Results: A significant difference in treatment motivation was found according to the individual<e2><80><99>s age, educational status, and income level, duration of substance use and number of substances used, family problems, and psychiatric comorbidity. In addition, the most important predictive variables for treatment motivation are the individual<e2><80><99>s income level, the presence of children, family problems, and coping strategies. Conclusion: Cognitive and behavioral studies should be undertaken to strengthen social support mechanisms, to increase the supportive participation of family members, and to develop coping strategies as well as motivational techniques in order to increase the individuals<e2><80><99> compliance and motivation.

We show that there is a strong parallel between triads and dyads. Work-oriented groups are faster and walk at a larger distance between them than leisure-oriented ones, while the latter move in a less ordered way. Such differences are present also when colleagues are contrasted with friends and families; nevertheless the similarity between friend and colleague behaviour is greater than the one between family and colleague behaviour. Male triads walk faster than triads including females, males keep a larger distance than females, and same gender groups are more ordered than mixed ones. Groups including tall people walk faster, while those with elderly or children walk at a slower pace. Groups including children move in a less ordered fashion. Results concerning relation and gender are particularly strong, and we investigated whether they hold also when other properties are kept fixed. While this is clearly true for relation, patterns relating gender often resulted to be diminished. For instance, the velocity difference due to gender is reduced if we compare only triads in the colleague relation. The effects on group dynamics due to intrinsic properties are present regardless of social interaction, but socially interacting groups are found to walk in a more ordered way. This has an opposite effect on the space occupied by non-interacting dyads and triads, since loss of structure makes dyads larger, but causes triads to lose their characteristic V formation and walk in a line (i.e., occupying more space in the direction of movement but less space in the orthogonal one).

Prior research suggests that health literacy plays an important role in e-cigarette beliefs, including perceived benefits and risks of e-cigarette use, as well as e-cigarette dependence. Yet, limited work has examined risk factors of poor e-cigarette health literacy. From a biopsychological perspective, sex and pain severity represent two constructs that may impact e-cigarette health literacy. To date, however, no research has investigated differences in e-cigarette health literacy across pain, sex, or their interrelation. Thus, the present study was conducted to evaluate the interactive effect of pain severity and sex on e-cigarette health literacy. Participants included 319 current, adult e-cigarette users (60.5% female, Mage = 36.82 years, SD = 10.62). Findings supported a significant pain by sex interaction, such that pain related to e-cigarette health literacy among women (b = .10, SE = .03, P < .001), but not men (b = .01, SE = .03, P = .60). The present findings suggest that pain may uniquely impact the degree to which women, but not men, seek and understand information on e-cigarettes.

Published research has indicated the powerful rewarding effects of drug use, which in the case of opiates like morphine may lead to drug addiction and maladaptive decision making with negative social consequences. In-depth comprehension of the role of responsible mechanisms in addiction can lead us to better and more effective treatments for drug dependence. Continuing previous work in our laboratory, in this study we aimed to investigate the role of dopamine D1- and D2-like receptors in the dentate gyrus (DG) on the reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior induced by the combination of forced swim stress and a subthreshold dose of morphine on extinguished morphine-conditioned place preference in rats. The rats were bilaterally implanted with 2 separate cannulas into the DG region. After the extinction phase of morphine<e2><80><93>conditioned place preference, the animals received different doses (0.5, 2, and 4 <ce><bc>g per 0.5 <ce><bc>L vehicle/side) of SCH-23390 or sulpiride on the reinstatement day and were tested for the combination of forced swim stress and a subthreshold dose of morphine in discrete groups. Our findings indicated that D1- and D2-like receptor antagonists attenuated the reinstatement induced by the combination of FSS and the subthreshold dose of morphine. The reduction was more robust in groups of animals that received sulpiride as compared with SCH-23390.

Drawing on qualitative case study data in non<e2><80><90>profit facilities, the article argues that the main industrial relations challenges facing long<e2><80><90>term care workers are that their workplace priorities do not fit within existing, gendered, industrial relations processes and institutions. This article starts from the experience of women and threads this experience through other layers of social organization such as: global and local policy directions including austerity, New Public Management, and social and healthcare funding; industrial relations mechanisms and policy; and workers<e2><80><99> formal [union] and informal efforts to represent their interests in the workplace. The strongest themes in the reported experience of the women include: manufacturing conditions for unpaid work; increasing management and state dependence on unpaid care work; fostering loose boundaries; and limiting respect and autonomy as aspects of care work. The article extends the feminist political economy by analysing the links between the policies noted above and frontline care work. Building on gendered organizational theory the article also introduces the concept of non<e2><80><90>job work and suggests a fourth industrial relations institution, namely the needs and gendered expectations of residents, families and workers themselves, operating within the liminal spaces in care work.

In environmental data, for example, a standard approach usually adopted by the Environmental Protection Agencies to handle missing values is by deleting those observations with incomplete information from the study, obtaining a massive underestimation of many indexes usually used for evaluating air quality. In multivariate time series, moreover, it may happen that not only isolated values but also long sequences of some of the time series<e2><80><99> components may miss. In such cases, it is quite impossible to reconstruct the missing sequences basing on the serial dependence structure alone. In this work, we propose a new procedure that aims to reconstruct the missing sequences by exploiting the spatial correlation and the serial correlation of the multivariate time series, simultaneously. The proposed procedure is based on a spatial-dynamic model and imputes the missing values in the time series basing on a linear combination of the neighbor contemporary observations and their lagged values. It is specifically oriented to spatio-temporal data, although it is general enough to be applied to generic stationary multivariate time-series. In this paper, the procedure has been applied to the pollution data, where the problem of missing sequences is of serious concern, with remarkably satisfactory performance.

The Internet Addiction Test was given to military medical and nursing students and housestaff to assess problematic Internet use. Methods: Medical and nursing students at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and residents from Naval Medical Center San Diego were contacted via email (n = 1,000) and given a survey that included the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and questions asking about other specific lifestyle variables. Individuals who received an Internet Addiction Score (IAS) <e2><89><a5>50 were identified as likely experiencing harmful effects of Internet addiction (IA). Results: Of 399 surveys submitted, 68 were omitted due to gross incompletion or failing to finish the entirety of the IAT. Of the participants included, 205 (61.1%) were male and 125 (37.9%) were female. The mean age was 28.6 years old (S.D. = 5.1 years). In regards to training status, completed surveys were assessed for 94 medical residents, 221 School of Medicine students, and 16 Graduate School of Nursing students. Our survey showed 5.5% of the participants (n = 18) indicated problems with Internet use that are concerning for IA. Conclusions: The study results indicated that our population showed problematic Internet use in the lower range of global estimates of IA. Rates of IA further decreased between medical students and residents. Multiple lifestyle variables were significantly associated with IA score and may serve as indicators of a higher score. Interestingly, the use of social media during sleeping hours was most significantly associated with increased IAS. This paper discusses IA among military medical and nursing trainees and how problematic Internet use may affect work performance and force readiness.

This has led to the assumption that taking large amounts of drug during extended daily bouts is necessary to develop an addiction phenotype. Recent work shows that within<e2><80><90>session intermittent access (IntA) to cocaine produces much less drug intake than continuous<e2><80><90>access procedures (i.e. long<e2><80><90>access sessions) but evokes addiction symptoms more effectively. IntA<e2><80><90>sessions are also long, typically lasting 6 hours. It is not known whether IntA<e2><80><90>sessions must be extended to promote addiction<e2><80><90>relevant changes in drug use over time. Here, we determined the influence of IntA<e2><80><90>session length on patterns of cocaine use relevant to addiction. Two groups of male Wistar rats self<e2><80><90>administered cocaine (0.25 mg/kg/injection, injected over 5 seconds) during 18 daily IntA<e2><80><90>sessions. One group had long 6<e2><80><90>hour sessions (Long<e2><80><90>IntA), the other group had shorter, 2<e2><80><90>hour sessions (Short<e2><80><90>IntA). Only Long<e2><80><90>IntA rats escalated their cocaine intake over sessions, but both groups developed a burst<e2><80><90>like pattern of drug use over time and similar levels of psychomotor sensitization. The two groups also showed robust and similar levels of both responding for cocaine under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement and cocaine<e2><80><90>induced reinstatement of extinguished drug<e2><80><90>seeking behavior. In summary, long IntA<e2><80><90>sessions lead to greater cocaine intake than shorter IntA<e2><80><90>sessions, but the two conditions are equally effective in evoking the patterns of drug<e2><80><90>taking and drug<e2><80><90>seeking that define addiction. This suggests that chronic intermittent cocaine use, even during short daily bouts, is sufficient to promote addiction symptoms.

However, these associations have been explored mainly with undergraduates, focusing primarily on conflict rather than emotional disengagement. The current study examined the associations between Facebook addiction and marital disaffection (e.g., loss of love, emotional disengagement) amongst 138 (95 females and 43 males) cohabiting married Facebook users residing in the United States. The results revealed that Facebook addiction and marital disaffection were positively related, even after controlling for relationship commitment. Additionally, greater relationship commitment weakened the association between Facebook addiction and marital disaffection. There are likely multiple explanations for the current findings; however, results suggest that higher levels of relationship commitment may protect spouses against the negative relationship outcomes associated with Facebook addiction. Future longitudinal work with couples is needed to clarify the directionality of the relationship between Facebook addiction and marital disaffection.

The present study utilized behavioral methods from the addiction literature to assess whether (a) foods differ in their associations with subjective experience indicators of abuse liability and (b) individual differences in subjective experiences and eating behavior emerge using the Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (YFAS 2.0). Women (n = 44) with overweight or obesity, 38.6% with YFAS 2.0 food addiction, rated facets of subjective experience (e.g., craving) during a taste test task and ad libitum consumption period. A hierarchical linear model assessed whether foods were differentially associated with each subjective experience (Level 1) and individual differences by food addiction (Level 2). Associations between subjective experiences and eating behavior were also examined. Highly processed, relative to minimally processed, foods were more associated with indicators of abuse liability, although individuals with food addiction reported decreased enjoyment for and intentions to consume highly processed foods. Subjective experiences were associated with greater consumption of highly processed foods for participants with food addiction. The present work provides further support for the rewarding nature of highly processed foods, evidenced by closer associations with subjective experiences reported for drugs of abuse compared to minimally processed foods. In addition, highly processed food intake was related to elevated subjective experience reports for these foods for those with food addiction, paralleling findings in individuals with a substance-use disorder for the relevant drug.

This research has underscored the detrimental effects of workaholism for employees, their families, and the organizations that employ them. Despite drastic improvements in the quality of studies examining workaholism over the past several decades, researchers continue to almost exclusively rely on older measures of workaholism or new measures derived from these original measures. In the present study, we outline why a new measure is needed and propose a multidimensional conceptualization of workaholism that encompasses motivational, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions. We then develop and validate a new multidimensional measure of workaholism: the Multidimensional Workaholism Scale (MWS). Evidence from 5 samples representing individuals working in a wide variety of occupations and industries throughout the United States (total N = 1,252) provides support that (a) our proposed 4-factor structure replicates and fits better than alternative models; (b) the measure demonstrates high reliability and content validity; (c) the measure demonstrates evidence for convergent and discriminant validity with constructs in workaholism<e2><80><99>s nomological network; (d) the measure demonstrates incremental validity in the prediction of important outcomes over and above prior measures of workaholism; and (e) the different dimensions demonstrate incremental validity in the prediction of specific outcomes over and above other dimensions of the MWS. Overall, results from the present study suggest that the MWS is a reliable and valid measure that can advance a more nuanced approach to research and practice relating to workaholism.

This study investigates the mediating role of work<e2><80><93>family conflict (WFC) on the relationship between workaholism and employee wellbeing and the moderating role of instrumental spousal support on this mediated model. The sample includes 244 dual-earner employees in various sectors. Drawing on the effort<e2><80><93>recovery model and the conservation of resources theory, our model posits that the mediating effect of WFC on the linkage between workaholism and employee wellbeing is contingent upon the levels of instrumental support. According to the moderated mediation analysis, WFC transmits the effects of workaholism on wellbeing and assumes a mediator role only when the employee perceives a low or medium level of instrumental spousal support. This highlights the importance of instrumental spousal support in decreasing the detrimental effects of workaholism and WFC on wellbeing. Instrumental spousal support seems to decrease the plausible effect of workaholism by reducing the perceived seriousness of family-related burdens. Thus, employees receiving spousal support are more likely to feel assisted and confident that their responsibilities at home will be met.

It was hypothesized that self-oriented perfectionism (SOP) and socially prescribed perfectionism (SPP) predict an increase in workaholism and that workload may exacerbate this association. Four hundred and thirty workers completed a self-report questionnaire at two different time points, and the hypothesized relationships were tested using structural equation modeling. Overall, SOP and SPP were not associated with workaholism over time. The interaction between SOP, but not SPP, and workload was significant. SOP predicted an increase in workaholism over time in workers facing high workload. Accordingly, SOP may be a risk factor for workaholism when workload is high.

Indeed, the link between workaholism and job performance is not obvious. In this paper, we investigated the link between workaholism and a core component of contextual performance, namely, prosocial organizational citizenship behavior (P-OCB). More in detail, we posited a mediational model in which workaholic tendencies negatively predicted P-OCB indirectly through an increased perception of job demands. This model was tested using longitudinal data from a sample of 85 police officers assessed once every two weeks for three months. Results from multilevel structural equation analyses demonstrated the model's good fit and corroborated the mediated effect.

Using CORE OM and a tailor made supplement for CSBD, clients were evaluated at the beginning of a psycho-educational groupwork program and then again at three-month follow-up. 36 clients were evaluated a second time six-months later. The study identified, through CORE OM, that 85% of the sample were experiencing <e2><80><98>clinical distress<e2><80><99> and 67% were at risk on intake.

The factor structure, reliability, and convergent validity of the POCS were tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA), and external variables. The results indicated that the POCS-Brazilian version (with seven-point and five-point Likert scale) replicated the unidimensional structure of the original instrument.

Both recent and remote works have suggested that various cultural factors such as personal religiousness and morality can influence both the experience and expression of compulsive sexual behaviors. Because prior works have indicated that pornography use is likely to be the most common expression of compulsive sexual behavior, the present work sought to examine whether moral incongruence about pornography use may account for a substantive part of self-reports of compulsive sexual behavior. In 2 studies involving 4 samples, the present work tested the hypothesis that moral incongruence would positively predict self-reported compulsivity in pornography use. In Study 1, across 3 samples (Sample 1, N = 467; Sample 2, N = 739; Sample 3, N = 1,461), including 2 matched to U.S. nationally representative norms (Samples 2 and 3), results indicated that moral incongruence was a substantive and robust predictor of self-reported compulsivity. In Study 2 (baseline N = 850), parallel process latent growth curve analyses over the course of 1 year revealed that the trajectories of pornography use, self-reported compulsivity, and moral disapproval of such use covaried together over time. Collectively, these results underscore the contention that personal morality may influence individuals<e2><80><99> self-perceptions of their sexual behaviors, which, in turn, may complicate efforts to accurately diagnose compulsive sexual behavior disorder.

Method: Thirteen young people aged 16<e2><80><93>19 years, opting to go into work or apprenticeships following completion of compulsory education, were interviewed up to one year prior to the school to work transition. Participants were from two educational institutions in England (one further education college; one secondary school sixth form). Participants drew support networks and discussed these during semi-structured interviews. Transcripts and drawings were analysed using a critical discursive psychological (CDP) approach. Findings: Young people<e2><80><99>s construction of <e2><80><98>support<e2><80><99> is an active and discursive process. Mothers were the source of support young people drew first and talked about the most. Conversely, careers advisors were absent from support network drawings and discussed ambivalently, outside the notion of <e2><80><98>support<e2><80><99>. Positioning mothers as <e2><80><98>helpers<e2><80><99> is discussed and contrasted with careers advisors as <e2><80><98>hinderers<e2><80><99>. Limitations: Talk collected from semi-structured interviews rather than naturalistic talk could have shaped participants<e2><80><99> talk. All perspectives on support were from the young person<e2><80><99>s perspective and others, such as those of family members or teachers, were not directly included in the study. Conclusions and applications: Mothers are positioned in various ways by young people in this study, overall as <e2><80><98>helpers<e2><80><99>. Careers advisors are positioned as irrelevant or <e2><80><98>hinderers<e2><80><99>. Mapping networks is suggested as a tool to support young people<e2><80><99>s school to work transition, along with suggestions to bring practitioner psychologists from school and work domains closer together.

Linear regression analyses indicated that individuals in Mexico reported significantly greater scores on all obsessive-compulsive (OC) dimensions, when compared to those in the USA. The association between nationality and all OC symptom dimensions (except responsibility for harm) depended upon degree of spirituality; as spirituality increased, OCD severity decreased in the Mexican sample and increased in the USA sample. The potentially protective role of spirituality in Mexican participants may be explained by the collectivist culture, which can inform culturally-tailored interventions.

The objectives of this study were to report the prevalence and associated factors of burnout within the French neurosurgical community using validated academic and psychologic scales. Methods: A national survey was sent to 141 French residents and 432 neurosurgeons between April and July 2019. Burnout was surveyed using the Maslach burnout inventory. The survey included demographic data and several academic psychologic scales. A stepwise multiple regression was used to determine factors that are associated with burnout scores. Results: The response rate was 100% and 23.6% for residents and neurosurgeons, respectively. Prevalence of burnout within the French neurosurgical community was 49%. There were no significant differences between residents and neurosurgeons. Two categories of factors were associated with the main dimensions of burnout during the stepwise multiple regression: personality and factors related with neurosurgical practice. Personality types such as neuroticism were negatively associated with burnout while agreeableness was protective. Work addictive profile with excessive work and absorption at work were negatively associated. Factors associated with neurosurgical practice such as conflict of work into family life, unbalanced effort to reward ratio, work duration were negatively associated. Pleasure at work was protective. Conclusion: Prevalence of burnout is high among French neurosurgeons. Predictive models can be used to identify and prevent burnout among profiles at risk.

Building upon our previously successful in-person faculty training programs, we designed and pilot tested the brief online Faculty Education in Addiction Training (FEAT) Program for social work and internal medicine residency faculty. The present study examines baseline and post-FEAT Program AOD knowledge and teaching confidence and preparedness among faculty participants. Methods: The FEAT Program curriculum included didactic videos, online engagement with content experts, recommended readings, and a live virtual classroom experience. Participants completed self-assessments of knowledge and teaching confidence and preparedness pre- and post-FEAT program. Results: In this pilot test, thirty faculty completed the FEAT program: 15 social work and 15 internal medical residency program faculty. Both groups showed significant improvement (p < 0.001) in overall AOD-related knowledge with medium-to-large effects (Cohen<e2><80><99>s d = 1.83 [social work], 0.72 [medicine]). Both groups showed significant increases in teaching confidence (p < 0.001) for all items with large effects (Cohen<e2><80><99>s d values range from 1.08 to 1.92) and significant increases and large effects for all teaching preparedness items for social work (at least p < 0.01 | Cohen<e2><80><99>s d range = 1.03<e2><80><93>1.56) and internal medical residency faculty (p < 0.001 | Cohen<e2><80><99>s d range = 1.08<e2><80><93>1.69).

This study examines the role of supervisors<e2><80><99> BLM in fostering workaholism in subordinates. These supervisors, by creating a bottom-line driven environment, may intensify workaholism, leading to workplace cheating behavior. However, not all subordinates react in the same manner. We theorize that the positive relationship between supervisor BLM and workplace cheating behavior through workaholism is strengthened when the psychological entitlement is high. The moderation-mediation model was tested with data from 193 employees working in various industries. Our findings demonstrate that under conditions of high psychological entitlement, workaholism resulting from supervisor BLM leads to workplace cheating behavior.

We tested this model using an experience sampling study of 121 U.S. employees and their spouses who completed self-report surveys for 10 working days. Multilevel analyses supported the idea that workaholism varies at the daily level, and trait workaholism was significantly related to higher daily fluctuations in workaholism averaged across the 10 days. Consistent with whole trait theory (Fleeson, 2007), we found anticipated workload each morning positively related to daily fluctuations in workaholism. Moreover, individuals reported feeling more fatigued on days they report higher daily workaholism, and daily fluctuations in workaholism were related to stress crossover and spouse<e2><80><99>s relationship tension.

Moreover, mindfulness moderated the relationship between workaholism and NA such that as levels of mindfulness increased, the influence of workaholism on NA decreased.

In response to these calls, we examined the mediation roles of workload and emotional exhaustion in the relationship between workaholism and job performance across within-person and between-person levels. To test our hypotheses, we adopted a daily diary design to collect data from a sample of 119 employees over ten consecutive workdays. The results of multilevel analysis indicated that at the within-person level, daily workaholism was directly and indirectly (via daily workload and emotional exhaustion) related to daily performance. At the between-person level, workaholism did not directly affect performance, but indirectly affected performance via workload and emotional exhaustion. At both levels, the indirect effect of workaholism via workload canceled out the indirect effect via emotional exhaustion, resulting in a null indirect effect of workaholism on performance. Finally, this study supported a lack of multilevel homology in the direct and indirect effects of workaholism on job performance across within-person and between-person levels.

A total of 668 Lithuanian employees participated in a study. The sample included employees who worked in the workplace (n = 331), as well as those who worked completely from home (n = 337). The levels of workaholism were measured using DUWAS-10 (Schaufeli et al., 2009). A multidimensional perfectionism scale (Hewitt et al., 1991) was used for the measurement of perfectionism. Type A personality was assessed with the help of the Framingham type A personality scale (Haynes et al., 1980). It was revealed in a study that the positive relationship between perfectionism and work-a-holism was stronger in the group of complete remote workers. It was further found that the moderating role of the way of doing work was not significant for the relationship between type A personality and workaholism. Overall, the findings support the idea that remote work is an important variable determining the development of health-damaging working behaviors among those employees who excel perfectionistic attributes.

These associations were examined in a sample of 514 employees using latent change models, allowing us to obtain a direct and explicit estimate of change occurring in both constructs over a 3-year period. These analyses relied on a bifactor representation of work engagement and workaholism, allowing us to properly disaggregate the global and specific levels of both constructs in the estimation of these longitudinal associations. To further enrich our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms at play in these relations, we also considered associations between these two constructs and employees<e2><80><99> levels of harmonious and obsessive work passion, two other facets of heavy work investment. Our results revealed the longitudinal independence of employees<e2><80><99> global levels work engagement and workaholism, showing that longitudinal associations between these two constructs occurred at the specific, rather than global, level.

In Study 1 we hypothesised that workaholic tendencies would affect daily workload and that daily workload would mediate the relationship between workaholic tendencies and daily emotional exhaustion. Data were provided by 102 workers consisting mostly of entrepreneurs, managers and self-employed individuals, who were followed for ten consecutive working days. Multilevel structural equation modelling, controlling for the general level of workload, neuroticism and conscientiousness, supported the hypotheses. Building on the results of Study 1, in Study 2 we hypothesised that workaholism would lead in the long run to a decline in job performance. Study 2 considered 519 employees of a large organisation and focused on their supervisors<e2><80><99> performance ratings in two successive years. Workaholism was used to predict change in work performance. Work engagement was included in the model as a concurrent predictor of work performance.

Negative results have been associated with work demands (stress, anxiety and depression). Objective: In the present research we carried out a predictive study of work addiction by applying three questionnaires on depression and anxiety. Methods: In this study, the participants were 332 workers, obtained through non-probabilistic sampling. The FACTOR (version 7.2) and SPSS 23.0 programs were used. Results: The results of the correlation analysis show both positive and negative associations with the variables studied. We conclude that work addiction variables can predict anxiety and depression because we found that two variables predict 18.3% of depression and 20.3% of anxiety, which are feelings generated by work and excessive work. Conclusions: It can be concluded that feelings generated by work and excessive work predict anxiety and depression, thus the present research helps to broaden knowledge on work addiction, promoting a healthy lifestyle and prevent absenteeism.

A number of interventions and a large body of research exist related to improving employment outcomes of women in recovery, but most fail to account for employment as an on-going, uneven process. Objective: This study applied a longitudinal, qualitative design to explore employment experiences of women in recovery, as well as how those experiences interact with participants' sobriety, health, and well-being. Methods: Nineteen women from two residential recovery programs were interviewed four times over the course of nine months. Data were analyzed using longitudinal coding. Results: Women encounter on-going struggle to find and keep employment, and multiple forces exacerbate this struggle. At the same time, positive work experiences described by some participants illustrate opportunities for the creation of new workplace structures that address employment needs of women in recovery while supporting sobriety and overall well-being. Conclusion: Understanding employment as an on-going process that interacts with addiction and sobriety in complex and multiple ways could contribute to improved employment and health outcomes for women in recovery.

However, the mechanisms underlying such effects are unclear. Objectives and methods: Here we investigated effects of an acute catecholamine challenge with methylphenidate (20 mg, oral) on a novel probabilistic reversal learning paradigm in a within-subject, double-blind randomised design. The paradigm was designed to disentangle effects on punishment avoidance from effects on reward perseveration. Given the known large individual variability in methylphenidate<e2><80><99>s effects, we stratified our effects by working memory capacity and trait impulsivity, putatively modulating the effects of methylphenidate, in a large sample (n = 102) of healthy volunteers. Results: Contrary to our prediction, methylphenidate did not alter performance in the reversal phase of the task. Our key finding is that methylphenidate altered learning of choice-outcome contingencies in a manner that depended on individual variability in working memory span. Specifically, methylphenidate improved performance by adaptively reducing the effective learning rate in participants with higher working memory capacity. Conclusions: This finding emphasises the important role of working memory in reinforcement learning, as reported in influential recent computational modelling and behavioural work, and highlights the dependence of this interplay on catecholaminergic function.

We conducted 22 interviews with representatives from social service organisations funded by the government of Ontario, Canada, for anti-trafficking programming. These interviews provide insight into how trafficking is being represented and with what effects. Our findings suggest that organisational initiatives often rely on individualised health-related interventions, such as trauma-informed counselling and other mental health support, to address trafficking. In the process, various sex work activities are deemed <e2><80><98>symptoms<e2><80><99> of trafficking, and perceived pathways to engaging in sex work (such as drug use/dependence, a history of trauma and low self-esteem) are produced as <e2><80><98>causes<e2><80><99> or <e2><80><98>risk factors<e2><80><99>.

Limited research has explored the lived experiences of counselors who work in programs that have scaled-up MAT in response to the opioid crisis in the U.S. Thirty-one addiction counselors who worked in MAT programs that had scaled-up treatment capacity were interviewed about 3 facets of their lived experiences: work roles, work motivation, and perceived responses of others to their work. Interviews were taped and transcribed. An interdisciplinary team reviewed and coded the transcripts using grounded theory analysis. The main work roles that emerged were counselor, educator, and advocate. Counselors described multiple factors related to intrinsic motivation for their work: family and personal history, altruism, enjoyment of challenges and client complexity, and witnessing and facilitating change. Factors related to extrinsic motivation were workplace opportunities and positive feedback. The main themes concerning responses of nonclients were positive feedback; others<e2><80><99> narratives; negative feedback focused on the stigma associated with the treatment, the clients who receive it, and the counselors who provide it; and responses to anticipated negative feedback. Responses from clients were largely positive and focused on appreciation and respect.

To document the construct validity of these latent profiles, we relied on the circumplex model of employees<e2><80><99> well<e2><80><90>being to investigate whether they differed in terms of burnout, work satisfaction, and work addiction. Results from analyses conducted among a sample of 955 employees revealed five distinct profiles characterized by differing levels of global and specific forms of motivation: Intrinsically Motivated, Poorly Motivated, Driven, Conflicted, and Self<e2><80><90>Determined. Lower levels of burnout and work satisfaction were associated with profiles characterized by higher global levels of self<e2><80><90>determination and more autonomous forms of motivation, matching theoretical expectations.

Users of mentholated tobacco products typically have greater dependence as well as poorer cessation outcomes. These effects are thought to be partially driven by menthol<e2><80><99>s pleasing taste as well as menthol<e2><80><99>s masking of aversive tastants in tobacco products, thereby increasing their palatability. However, there are two predominant stereoisomers contained in mentholated products in varying proportions: (<e2><88><92>)-menthol and (+)-menthol. The palatability of these stereoisomers has not been directly tested. The objective of this study was to measure whether there are differences in oral taste preference among (<e2><88><92>)-menthol and (+)-menthol. Method: Using a two-bottle choice assay, we measured taste preference over a range of (<e2><88><92>)-menthol and (+)-menthol doses (10 mg/L, 50 mg/L, and 100 mg/L) in Sprague<e2><80><93>Dawley adolescent (postnatal day 33<e2><80><93>41) male and female rats. Results: Results showed a dose-dependent aversion to menthol at 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L (p < .0001), but not at 10 mg/L. These effects were not dependent on stereoisomer or sex. Conclusion: These findings suggest that (<e2><88><92>)-menthol and (+)-menthol are equally potent in producing oral taste aversion.

This work shows that different stereoisomers of menthol, (<e2><88><92>)-menthol and (+)-menthol, produce similar behavioral oral taste aversion responses in rats. This work suggests that both stereoisomers may play a role in masking unpleasant flavors, and therefore either may exacerbate tobacco dependence.

The present study contributes to the existing literature on the linkages of self-perceived income sufficiency and cognitive impairment. Study also provides additional insights on other socioeconomic and health-related variables that are associated with cognitive impairment in older ages. Methods: Data for this study is derived from the 'Building Knowledge Base on Population Ageing in India'. The final sample size for the analysis after removing missing cases was 9176 older adults. Descriptive along with bivariate analyses were presented to show the plausible associations of cognitive impairment with potential risk factors using the chi-square test. Also, binary logistic regression analysis was performed to provide the relationship between cognitive impairment and risk factors. The software used was STATA 14. Results: About 43% of older adults reported that they had no source of income and 7.2% had income but not sufficient to fulfil their basic needs. Older adults with income but partially sufficient to fulfil their basic needs had 39% significantly higher likelihood to suffer from cognitive impairment than older adults who had sufficient income [OR: 1.39; OR: 1.21<e2><80><93>1.59]. Likelihood of cognitive impairment was low among older adults with asset ownership than older adults with no asset ownership [OR: 0.83; CI: 0.72<e2><80><93>0.95]. Again, older adults who work by compulsion (73.3%) or felt mental or physical stress due to work (57.6%) had highest percentage of cognitive impairment. Moreover, older adults with poor self-rated health, low instrumental activities of daily living, low activities of daily living, low subjective well-being and low psychological health were at increased risk for cognitive impairment. Conclusion: The study highlights the pressing need for care and support and especially financial incentives in the old age to preserve cognitive health. Further, while planning geriatric health care for older adults in India, priority must be given to financially backward, with no asset ownership, with poor health status, older-older, widowed, and illiterate older individuals, as they are more vulnerable to cognitive impairment.

This study had a two-fold objective: First, to analyze which factors related to OMT for OD contribute to the abstinence of problematic use of non-prescribed opioids and sustain recovery, from the patients<e2><80><99> perspective; second, to understand which changes OMT produced in the individuals<e2><80><99> lives might significantly contribute to relapse prevention. Methods: We used qualitative methods of design, inquiry, and analysis from a convenience sample of 19 individuals in a Swedish treatment setting. Results: All the participants reported previous cycles of problematic use of non-prescribed opioids and other non-prescribed psychoactive substances, treatment, abstinence, recovery, and relapse before starting the current OMT program. During the pre-treatment stage, specific events, internal processes, and social environments enhanced motivation toward abstinence and seeking treatment. During the treatment stage, participants perceived the quality of the human relationships established with primary social groups as important as medication and the individual plan of care in sustaining recovery. From the participants<e2><80><99> perspective, OMT was a turning point in their life course, allowing them a sense of self-fulfillment and the reconstruction of personal and social identity. However, they still struggled with the stigmatization produced by a society that values abstinence-oriented over medication-assisted treatments. Conclusion: OMT is not an isolated event in individuals<e2><80><99> lives but rather a process occurring within a specific social context. Structural factors and the sense of acceptance and belonging are essential in supporting the transformation. Treatment achievements and the risk for relapse vary over time, so the objectives of the treatment plan must account for characteristics of the pre-treatment stage and the availability and capacity of individuals to restructure their social network, besides the opioid maintenance treatment and institutional social care.

It is widely believed that sex workers are either the victims of trafficking or have taken up sex work out of compulsion. Furthermore, it is often assumed that people who pursue sex work live in brothels or solicit customers outside their homes. Drawing on findings from an ethnographic study of the Kanjar community of northern India, this paper argues to the contrary. Veering away from accounts of individual women as victims, this paper focuses on dhandha (sex work) as a <e2><80><98>legitimate<e2><80><99> community practice. For the Kanjars, sex work is a traditional occupation with a long complex history and a distinct subculture embedded in its economic structure. For those involved, the family economy is based on the labour and earnings of unmarried women who earn income as dhandhewalis (sex workers). Sex work may not be an option that Kanjars choose, but it is certainly a practice that they are neither ashamed of, nor apologetic about. Their positive, if not defiant, attitude can be understood in the context of the specific subculture of the Kanjars. The term <e2><80><98>subculture<e2><80><99> as used here being specific to the community and its traditions, as distinct from dominant mainstream Indian culture.

We integrate theories of leader identity, self-sacrificial leadership, and self-regulation to develop a conceptual model articulating the manner in which strongly identifying with one<e2><80><99>s leader role on a daily basis yields benefits (i.e., increased task performance and perceived prosocial impact) and costs (i.e., increased depletion and conflict at home) via increased self-sacrificial leader behavior. Further, we theorize and test whether work addiction moderates the indirect effects of leader identity on the aforementioned processes. Using an experience sampling investigation of 80 leaders who completed 3 surveys per day for 10 workdays (Level 1 n = 645), we found that daily leader identity was positively associated with self-sacrificial leader behavior which, in turn, was positively associated with task performance and perceived prosocial impact (leader benefits) and positively associated with resource depletion and conflict at home (leader costs). Moreover, these effects were stronger for leaders who reported higher (vs. lower) levels of work addiction. In an exploration considering the effects of leader identity on daily well-being, results indicated that leader identity also indirectly helped and hindered psychological detachment from work.

We found evidence that liability to ADHD increases likelihood of smoking initiation and heaviness of smoking among smokers, decreases likelihood of smoking cessation, and increases likelihood of cannabis initiation. There was weak evidence that liability to ADHD increases alcohol dependence risk but not drinks per week or alcohol problems. In the other direction, there was weak evidence that smoking initiation increases ADHD risk, but follow<e2><80><90>up analyses suggested a high probability of horizontal pleiotropy. There was no clear evidence of causal pathways between ADHD and coffee consumption. Our findings corroborate epidemiological evidence, suggesting causal pathways from liability to ADHD to smoking, cannabis use, and, tentatively, alcohol dependence. Further work is needed to explore the exact mechanisms mediating these causal effects.

Results: This study shows that depression and workaholism levels are significantly lower in Physical Education students than other faculties' students. Gender moderates the relationship between workaholism and depression. Women demonstrate a stronger association between depression and workaholism than men. Conclusions: Both physical activity and gender appear to play an essential role in mental health prevention.

The study sample comprised 448 participants (279 females and 169 males) who completed a survey including the BWAS-T, Workaholism Battery (WorkBAT), Dutch Work Addiction Scale (DUWAS), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS). The Turkish version of BWAS had good internal consistency (Cronbach<e2><80><99>s <ce><b1> = .76). As expected, score on the BWAS-T was positively correlated with scores on the Drive subscale of the WorkBAT and Working Excessively and Working Compulsively subscales of the DUWAS. No relationship was found between the BWAS-T and Work Enjoyment subscale of the WorkBAT. Regarding concurrent validity, scores on the BWAS-T were strongly correlated with those on the DASS and its subscales. The factor structure of the BWAS-T was also tested using confirmatory factor analysis which found support for the original unidimensional factor structure. Results demonstrated that the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the BWAS were robust. Limitations and recommendations for further studies are discussed.

Furthermore, no study has investigated if the 'useless superiority effort' dimension of inferiority feelings, which indicates an increased need for superiority over others potentially to overcome self-perceived inferiorities, is related to other important personality dynamics. This study was therefore conducted to identify if potential perfectionism classes that exist among academicians (N = 317) can simultaneously explain significant differences in their tendencies toward workaholism, narcissism, and useless superiority effort, after controlling for potential social desirability effect. A latent class analysis of two dimensions of perfectionism (discrepancy and high standards) revealed four distinct classes of academicians; non-perfectionists (NONPs; 20%), maladaptive perfectionists (MPs; 17%), normal perfectionists (NPs; 44%) and adaptive perfectionists (APs; 19%). Further analysis (MANCOVA) showed that while MPs have the highest tendencies toward workaholism and useless superiority effort, NONPs have the lowest tendencies toward these. Moreover, APs reported significantly lower useless superiority than NPs, despite scoring similarly on both narcissism and workaholism. Additionally, based on workaholism being related to narcissism, high standards and discrepancy dimensions of perfectionism, as well as useless superiority effort, while weekly work hours are not, it can be suggested that workaholism is qualitatively different from working long hours.

Current evidence shows that tobacco addiction exerts their initial reinforcing effects by activating reward circuits in the brain, but the causal connectivity among reward circuits is still unclear. Therefore, it is vital to understand how the reward network works to lead to the compulsive smoking behaviour. Method: We applied dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to resting<e2><80><90>state functional magnetic resonance (rs<e2><80><90>fMRI) to characterize changes in effective connectivity (EC) among eight major hubs from reward network between 76 long<e2><80><90>term male smokers and 55 nonsmoking volunteers (matched with age, gender and education). Results: Relative to the healthy controls, long<e2><80><90>term smokers had stronger ECs from the right anterior insula to left ventral striatum, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) to ventral tegmental area (VTA), PCC to left anterior insula, left anterior insula to VTA, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) to PCC and weaker ECs from the VTA to left ventral striatum, right anterior insula to right ventral striatum, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to right anterior insula. Conclusions: Overall, our findings revealed disrupted neural causal interactions among parts of the reward network associated with tobacco addiction, expanding the growing evidence for the potential neurobiological mechanisms of tobacco addiction. We found abnormalities within the mesocorticolimbic system and a top<e2><80><90>down regulation disorder in the dopamine<e2><80><90>dependent process of response inhibition and salience attribution among long<e2><80><90>term smokers, which may facilitate the development of effective therapies in tobacco addiction.

This article discusses the compulsory work from home scenario and analyzes the perceptions and experiences of workers who have been forced to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying favorable and unfavorable factors for Quality of Work Life (QWL). We carried out a qualitative research based on Activity-Centered Ergonomics Applied to Quality of Life at Work (AEA_QLW) for twelve workers with varying positions in different public and private sector organizations. We analyzed their perceptions and experiences about working from home based on six categories examined by (AEA_QLW). The results revealed a balance: three of the categories largely concerning well-being (socio-professional relationships, recognition and professional growth, and use of computers) and three other categories largely concerning malaise (working conditions, work organization, and opinions of work), indicating possible focal points for interventions and care in maintaining this type of work. Important issues were discussed such as the lack of distinction between public and private spaces, the characteristics of current performance/fatigue, and the possible repercussions this can have on workers, their health, and on organizations.

Undertaking the compulsory field work component of social work studies can be particularly complex for international students, as they have to acquire an understanding of social work practice, knowledge and skills in a new cultural context. Prior research has highlighted the importance of supporting students and field educators to ensure successful quality learning experiences for international students in social work field education experiences. This paper reports on a subset of 35 international students who responded to a 2019 field education supervision survey in one Australian state, Queensland. The findings highlight that more international than domestic students are placed in placements with external supervision, that the overall the student cohort is younger than domestic students and that more international students reported longer supervision sessions. Despite field placements often being personally challenging international students rated their supervision experiences positively, and highlighted the opportunities it provided for support, learning and professional development. Students recognised that the process helped them understand concepts of critical reflection and an appreciation of the value of supervision and professional support for their ongoing professional development.

The mediating role of work<e2><80><93>life balance and employees' satisfaction with new ways of working in the relationship between new ways of working and innovative work behaviour was also examined. Building on established measurement scales, a questionnaire<e2><80><90>based deductive approach was used to collect data. In total, 457 faculty members were randomly selected from universities in countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council. New ways of work and innovative work behaviour were confirmed as multidimensional concepts. The study participants were clustered in three profiles according to their level of perception of the research variables. New ways of working practices apart from advanced ITC<e2><80><90>based communications were significantly positively related to innovative work behaviour, and work<e2><80><93>life balance was significantly positively related to satisfaction. Satisfaction with new ways of working and work<e2><80><93>life balance is a vital mechanism of innovative work behaviour, and satisfaction mediates work<e2><80><93>life balance and innovative work behaviour. Our research theoretically extends understanding of the compulsory new ways of working and innovative work behaviour in higher education institutions.

Studies of gender, sexuality and service labor approached mainstream service work as a scene of compulsory heterosexuality, while literature on the position of queer workers has tended to approach work in terms of structural inequalities that prevent queer workers from participating in the labor market, and has therefore focused on notions of diversity and inclusion as frameworks for understanding how the heteronormativity of service relationships can be overcome. This paper shifts focus to examine how queer subjectivities are enacted within the disciplinary requirements of service labor, and on the way that workers negotiate and contest their positioning at work. The paper situates the subjectivities and laboring practices of queer workers at the nexus of tensions between heteronormativity and the politics of diversity in service venues, and examines how workers negotiate and contest their positioning at work. We explore the normativities that shape permissible queer embodiment at work and show how biographical experiences specific to queer workers inform their laboring practices. The paper shows that queer workers in mainstream hospitality venues are enrolled into a specific mode of interactive service labor that capitalizes on their queer biographies, requires highly cultivated relational capacities, and repositions work as a site of political intervention.

Mark Street, Winona, MN, US, 55987","Sign- and goal-tracking are behaviors seen in many species when a conditioned stimulus and it<e2><80><99>s corresponding unconditioned stimulus are presented at separate locations, and have been the focus of studies on appetitive conditioned and drug dependence. The neurochemical basis of sign-tracking is of interest for both studies of basic conditioning and addiction. In this work, I examined the role of norepinephrine by employing two noradrenergic drugs used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)<e2><80><94>(a) atomoxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake blocker, and (b) guanfacine, an <ce><b1>2A-adrenergic receptor agonist. Sprague-Dawley rats were trained using a standard Pavlovian conditioning procedure with a retractable lever as conditioned stimulus and sucrose pellets as unconditioned stimulus. It was found that while atomoxetine reduced both sign- (both doses) and goal-tracking (only at the higher dose), guanfacine did not have any effect on either behavior. While norepinephrine reuptake blocking may be an effective strategy for reducing sign-tracking, manipulation of the <ce><b1>2A-adrenergic receptor appears less viable. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) This study found that a drug used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatment, atomoxetine, reduces sign-tracking, a behavior used as a model of impulsive behavior, but that another drug, guanfacine, does not. Reduction of impulsivity in this fashion may be important in the prevention of relapse into addiction.

Merry Avenue, Bowling Green, OH, US, 43403","Objective: Diagnostic guidelines for compulsive sexual behavior disorder note that moral distress related to sexual behavior is not sufficient to receive the diagnosis. Recent work has questioned the uniqueness of moral distress in predicting self-reported feelings of sexual addiction, demonstrating that other so-called addictive behaviors (e.g., gaming and internet use) are well-predicted by moral disapproval of those behaviors. The present work tested if moral incongruence (the interaction of behavioral frequency and moral disapproval of a behavior) is uniquely related to sexual behavior, or if it generalizes to other addictions as well. Method: This work used a large sample (N = 4,363) involving a representative sample of the U.S. population (n = 2,806) and a sample of sports-wagering individuals in the U.S. (n = 1,557). Interactions between moral disapproval and behavioral frequency were tested for several behaviors (i.e., pornography use, gambling, and several substances). Results: The interaction of behavioral frequency and behavioral disapproval (i.e., moral incongruence) predicted self-reported feelings of addiction to pornography and gambling. Moral incongruence was consistently unrelated to self-reported feelings of addiction to tobacco, illicit substances, and prescription drugs. Results regarding alcohol and marijuana were inconclusive. Conclusions: Moral incongruence is clearly a salient factor in understanding compulsive sexual behavior, and it appears to also be salient to gambling disorder. Though moral incongruence does not seem relevant to some substances (i.e., nicotine, prescription drug misuse, or illicit drug use), further research is needed regarding the effect of moral incongruence on self-reported feelings of addiction to alcohol and marijuana. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved) The new diagnosis of compulsive sexual behavior disorder in the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases specifically notes that distress related to moral objections about sexual behavior should not be taken as a symptom of the disorder. The present work demonstrates that this caveat is important, as moral beliefs about sexual behavior do influence whether people feel they are addicted to sexual behaviors. However, the present study shows that these moral beliefs also influence feelings of addiction to gambling and, potentially, other addictive behaviors.

Here, we use long-term data to evaluate how a measure of individual breeding investment (the egg volume) of three long-lived and long-distance-migrating seabirds is influenced by i) a large-scale climatic index (the North Atlantic Oscillation) and ii) local-scale variables (food abundance, foraging conditions, and competition). Winter values of the North Atlantic Oscillation did not correlate with local-scale variables measured in spring, but surprisingly, both had a high predictive power of the temporal variability of the egg volume in the three study species, even though they have different life-history strategies. The importance of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation suggests carry-over effects of winter conditions on subsequent breeding investment. Interestingly, the most important local-scale variables measured in spring were associated with food detectability (foraging conditions) and the factors influencing its accessibility (foraging conditions and competition by density-dependence). Large-scale climatic indices may work better as predictors of foraging conditions when organisms perform long distance migrations, while local-scale variables are more appropriate when foraging areas are more restricted (e.g. during the breeding season). Contrary to what is commonly assumed, food abundance does not directly translate into food intake and its detectability and accessibility should be considered in the study of food-related ecological processes.

Method: A thematic qualitative analysis was conducted to extract employment-related themes from 21 sets of addiction counselors<e2><80><99> case notes of couple therapy sessions (average 10 sessions per case) from a randomized controlled trial of Congruence Couple Therapy (CCT). Case notes were examined for the types of employment issues to answer the research question: What are the interconnections of employment, couple adjustment and addictive behaviors as revealed in the CCT counselors<e2><80><99> case notes? Results: Five key areas of employment-related stress were identified: (1) unemployment, (2) financial concerns, (3) history of crime, (4) overworking and workaholism, and (5) workplace conflict. These themes interacted negatively with couple adjustment and addictive behaviors. Using CCT as an intervention, clients gained skills in 4 areas transferred to employment: (1) awareness of self, other and family of origin, (2) congruent communication, (3) work-family balance, and (4) enlisting spousal support. These themes intersected with enhanced work functioning and reduced stress, alcohol use and gambling. Conclusion: Employment problems negatively impacted addictive behaviors, couple adjustment and well-being of partners and clients. Skills and awareness gained in CCT promoted changes in addicted clients<e2><80><99> employment functioning and coping with employment stress. The domains of work and couple adjustment are mutually influential in increasing or reducing stress with implications for addiction recovery.

We also compared FSWs<e2><80><99> reasons for those who entered sex work as a minor ( < 18) versus those as an adult ( <e2><89><a5> 18). We recruited 1347 FSWs who reported having sex in exchange for money, goods, services, or drugs with at least two clients in the previous year in 13 large cities. Participants were asked about their main reason for entering into sex work. Overall, economic hardship was the main reason for entry into sex work (56.2%), followed by personal choice (20.2%), environmental forces (16.6%), and drug use (7.0%). While economic hardship was the main reason in all birth cohorts, it decreased from 68.3% among FSWs born before 1970 to 39.6% among those born in 1990 or later. Compared to women who began sex work as adults, women who entered sex work as minors were more likely to report environmental forces (31.5% vs. 15.2%, P < 0.001) and less likely to report economic hardship as reasons for beginning sex work (36.2% vs. 58.7%, P = 0.003). Our data suggest that the engagement of women in sex work in Iran is multi-factorial. The main factor is dependence on sex work for income which highlights the need for economic empowerment programs. Programs should also target environmental forces and provide access to social support services for those who have entered sex work as minors.

It is related to several indicators of maladjustment, yet there is limited research on its correlates in the workplace, where it may be particularly relevant as emotional experiences deeply influence organizational life. In two experience<e2><80><90>sampling studies, we studied temporal dependency of negative emotional states at work in terms of emotional inertia. In a first study (n = 128), we investigated the association between exhaustion, the core dimension of burnout, with inertia of negative emotions. In a second study (n = 116), we aimed to replicate findings from the first study and additionally examined the moderating role of inertia of negative emotions in the relationship between negative emotions at work and counterproductive work behaviour. The findings show that exhaustion is consistently associated with inertia of negative emotions, and that inertia of negative emotions aggravates the relation between negative emotions and workers' counterproductive work behaviour.

Interestingly, there is very little research available concerning factors that may be involved with these adverse attitudes. While extant research suggests social workers demonstrate low empathy toward clients with a Substance Use Disorder (SUD), there is little empirical exploration of the relationship between dispositional empathy and subsequent attitudes. Similarly, a practitioner<e2><80><99>s spirituality may also influence their views of SUD clients, yet there is little evidence investigating this relationship. This study explored the relationship between empathy, spirituality, and attitudes toward clients with SUDs. Results demonstrated that both empathy and spirituality have some predictive potential and that some dimensions of empathy and spirituality interact. The results also showed that different dimensions were important for social work students and social work practitioners.

Yet, the affective experience of workaholics at work and their emotional reactivity to job stressors have been poorly investigated, with the few available studies being cross-sectional or based on retrospective reports obtained outside the working time. Here, we conducted an experience sampling study to characterize workaholics<e2><80><99> affective experience during work and their emotional reactivity to workday accumulation and momentary workload. A total of 139 full-time back-office workers participated in a 3-day protocol by reporting on their hedonic tone and momentary workload up to six times per workday. Multilevel modeling was used to investigate the relationship between trait workaholism and job-related hedonic tone as well as the cross-level interactions between workaholism and both workday accumulation and momentary workload. As expected, our results showed lower job-related hedonic tone for individuals with higher workaholic tendencies, with workaholism interacting with the two investigated job stressors. However, contrary to our hypotheses, we found that workaholism weakened, rather than strengthening, the negative trend of hedonic tone over the levels of both predictors, a result possibly explained by a blunted reactivity condition due to chronic job strain. Moreover, we corroborated previous findings suggesting worse outcomes in workaholic women compared to workaholic men. Organizations should consider taking action to monitor and manage the workaholism levels in the workforce and to create a psychosocial work environment that discourages the enactment of workaholic tendencies.

For that reason, it is imperative that researchers uncover possible variables that can alleviate its potentially harmful effects. Objective: This study aims to examine the relationship between workaholism, psychological capital (PsyCap), physical health, and work stress. The potential mitigating role that PsyCap could play between workaholism and physical health, as well as work stress, was also examined. Methods: Data on workaholism, PsyCap, physical health, and work stress were collected from 343 full-time faculty and staff from a large Southeastern university. Results: Results showed workaholism negatively related to physical health and positively related to work stress. Additionally, PsyCap had a positive relationship with physical health and a negative relationship with work stress. Moreover, PsyCap moderated the relationship between workaholism and work stress, such that as PsyCap increased, the relationship between workaholism and work stress weakened. Conclusions: PsyCap may be a fairly simple and cost-effective intervention for organizations to implement, as it can be learned through short training sessions. By incorporating PsyCap, organizations may be able to help mitigate levels of stress in their employees, specifically among those who suffer from workaholism.

We tested a path analysis model on 364 Italian workers, with servant leadership as a predictor of HWI and HWI as a predictor of Organizational Citizenship Behaviors (OCB) and Counterproductive Work Behaviors (CWB). We also performed ANOVAs and MANOVAs. Among the main findings, servant leadership is a positive predictor of both workaholism and work engagement. Work engagement is a positive predictor of OCB and a negative predictor of CWB. Conversely, workaholism, is a positive predictor of CWB, but it does not predict OCB. Hence, we encourage implementing soft-skills interventions aimed at making leaders aware of the different worker types in their organization to develop tailored measures to foster work engagement rather than workaholism. Also, we recommend controlling for work engagement when analyzing workaholism, given the different findings that arose when controlling or not controlling for work engagement.

The aim of this study was to investigate the combined effects of flow experience and workaholism on burnout among neurosurgery residents. Adopting a person-centered approach, we sought to identify subpopulations of neurosurgery residents with distinct profiles based on their levels of workaholism and flow at work. We then examined the links between these profiles and occupational burnout. Survey data were obtained from 141 residents enrolled on a neurosurgery program in France. Results revealed two profiles that differentiated between individuals with high- versus low-flow experiences, but not with high versus low workaholism scores. As expected, burnout differed significantly between the two profiles: 19.8% of residents with the low flow at work profile had severe overall burnout, compared with just 11.1% with the high flow at work profile, while 37.5% of residents with the low flow at work profile were characterized by high levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, compared with 26.7% with the high flow at work profile. The low flow at work profile was also characterized by higher levels of neuroticism. Results suggest that neurosurgical residents with higher levels of neuroticism experience less flow at work, and are thus less protected from burnout. It is therefore important to investigate these factors in prevention programs.

However, limited work exists on the prospective stability of the MPT. Furthermore, cannabis demand among veterans endorsing cannabis use, and the prospective cyclical relationship between demand and use over time, have yet to be investigated. Method: Two waves of data from a veteran sample (N = 133) reporting current (past 6-month) cannabis use were analyzed to assess stability in cannabis demand over 6 months. Autoregressive cross-lagged panel models (CLPMs) assessed the longitudinal associations between demand indices (i.e., intensity, Omax,Pmax, breakpoint) and cannabis use. Results: Baseline cannabis use predicted greater intensity (<ce><b2> = .32, p < .001), Omax (<ce><b2> = .37, p < .001), breakpoint (<ce><b2> = .28, p < .001), and Pmax (<ce><b2> = .21, p = .017) at 6 months. Conversely, baseline intensity (<ce><b2> = .14, p = .028), breakpoint (<ce><b2> = .12, p = .038), and Pmax (<ce><b2> = .12, p = .043), but not Omax, predicted greater use at 6 months. Only intensity demonstrated acceptable prospective reliability. Conclusions: Cannabis demand demonstrated stability over 6 months in CLPM models, varying along with natural changes in cannabis use. Importantly, intensity, Pmax, and breakpoint displayed bidirectional predictive associations with cannabis use, and the prospective pathway from use to demand was consistently stronger. Test<e2><80><93>retest reliability ranged from good to poor across indices. Findings highlight the value of assessing cannabis demand longitudinally, particularly among clinical samples, to determine how demand fluctuates in response to experimental manipulation, intervention, and treatment.

Moreover, previous literature denotes a prevalence of mental health disorders higher than that of the general population among correctional workers and public safety personnel. In the present study, we examine the prevalence of alcohol use disorders among correctional workers employed in the provincial correctional service in Ontario, Canada (n = 915), to understand the severity of the concern and to explain how alcohol use is associated with diverse mental health concerns. Specifically, we unpack the correlation between problematic alcohol use, mental health disorders, and suicide behaviours among this correctional worker population, finding that the prevalence of mental health disorders and suicide thoughts and behaviours was higher for persons reporting problematic alcohol use. Discussion includes recommendations on research needs tied to unpacking the relationship, including causal relationship between alcohol use and mental health, as a way to combat the devastating realities tied to compromised mental health endured by employees in correctional services. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved) We found relatively low prevalence of alcohol use disorder among provincial correctional workers, which suggests that perhaps awareness of the impacts of addiction given their work with criminalized people may be affecting alcohol use. However, mental health disorders and suicide behaviours were strongly associated with alcohol use disorders, indicating that improving the mental health and well-being of correctional workers remains an important public health priority. More needs to be done to disambiguate the comorbidity between alcohol use disorder and other mental health disorders among correctional workers.

However, the mechanisms underlying this association are not well understood. This study aimed to determine the serial mediation effects of sleep quality and fatigue on the relationship between SMA and academic engagement among college students. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 2661 college students (43.3% males, mean age = 19.97 years). The participants completed the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, the Utrecht Student Work Engagement Scale for Students, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Fatigue Assessment Scale. The serial mediation effects were examined using Model 6 in the Hayes<e2><80><99> PROCESS macro for SPSS. Results: The results showed that SMA among college students had a direct negative relationship with their academic engagement (Effect = <e2><88><92> 0.051, 95% CI: <e2><88><92>0.087 to <e2><88><92> 0.015). In addition, sleep quality and fatigue mediated the relationship between SMA and academic engagement both independent and serially, with the independent mediation effect of sleep quality being <e2><88><92> 0.031 (95% CI: <e2><88><92>0.048 to <e2><88><92> 0.016), the independent mediation effect of fatigue being <e2><88><92> 0.109 (95% CI: <e2><88><92>0.133 to <e2><88><92> 0.088), and the serial mediation effect of sleep quality and fatigue being <e2><88><92> 0.080 (95% CI: <e2><88><92>0.095 to <e2><88><92> 0.066). The total indirect effect of the three mediation paths was 80.9%. Conclusions: Decreased academic engagement caused by SMA can be aggravated by poor sleep quality and fatigue. Strengthening supervision and intervention in social media use among college students, supplemented by attention to psychosomatic health, including sleep quality and fatigue could promote their engagement in academic work.

This study took place within the HRM, a municipality of 448,500 people [1]. During the pandemic many critical services were interrupted while overdose events increased. We wanted to understand the experiences of people who use drugs as well as their HCPs during the first year of the pandemic. Methodology: We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 13 people who use drugs and 6 HCPs, including physicians who work in addiction medicine (3), a pharmacist, a nurse, and a community-based opioid agonist therapy (OAT) program staff member. Participants were recruited within HRM. Interviews were held via phone or videoconference due to social distancing directives. Interviews focused on the challenges people who use drugs and HCPs faced during the pandemic as well as elicited perspectives on a safe supply of drugs and the associated barriers and facilitators to the provision of a safe supply. Results Of the 13 people who use drugs who participated in this study, ages ranged from 21<e2><80><93>55 years (mean 40). Individuals had spent on average 17 years in HRM. Most people who use drugs (85%, n = 11) utilized income assistance, the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit, or disability support. Many had experienced homelessness (85%, n = 11) and almost half (46%, n = 6) were currently precariously housed in the shelter system. The main themes among interviews (people who use drugs and HCPs) were housing, accessing healthcare and community services, shifts in the drug supply, and perspectives on safe supply. Conclusions: We identified several challenges that people who use drugs face in general, but especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Access to services, housing support, and interventions to use safely at home were limited. As many challenges faced by people who use drugs exist outside of COVID-19, we concluded that the formal and informal interventions and changes in practice that were made to support people who use drugs should be sustained well past the end of the pandemic. The need for enhanced community supports and a safe supply of drugs, despite its complicated nature, is essential for the health and safety of people who use drugs in HRM, especially during COVID-19.

We show that inaction inertia is rooted in reference dependence. This is consistent with prior work finding that smaller discounts are devalued and inertia is motivated by avoidance of loss. We further illuminate the process by showing that consumers treat the missed discount (rather than the regular price) as a reference point relative to which a smaller discount feels like a loss. Missing a significantly better deal causes people to focus first and foremost on thoughts critical of the current deal. Notably, consumers who miss a smaller discount also construe the second deal as a loss, even if they take it. This research integrates inaction inertia and reference dependence theory using query theory analysis to contextualize inaction inertia with biases such as loss aversion, anchoring, and the default effect.

Bereaved spouses have significantly increased risk of chronic inflammation, and ultimately greater morbidity and mortality. High levels of proinflammatory cytokines are related to negative health outcomes. In bereavement, the ability to successfully regulate emotion is a vital skill for healthy coping and may represent a key psychological mechanism accounting for varying degrees of resilience. Psychological distancing is a frequently adaptive emotion regulation strategy in which an individual appraises a negative situation by taking a step back and distancing oneself, and coolly evaluates what is happening. The objective of the present work was to investigate whether psychological distancing, implemented implicitly via natural language use (i.e., linguistic distancing [LD]), is related to inflammation and bereavement-related health indicators. Method: Participants (N = 144) underwent a blood draw for the inflammation assay, completed questionnaire measures evaluating grief symptoms and health, and completed an oral task describing their relationship with their deceased spouse, which was used for the lexical analyses. Results: We found that LD was significantly associated with a panel of a priori proinflammatory stimulated cytokines (TNF-<ce><b1>, IL-6, IFN-<ce><b3>, IL-17A, and IL-2), bereavement-related health indices, and the relationship between grief symptoms and inflammation varied depending on the participants<e2><80><99> implementation of LD. Conclusions: LD may have a buffering effect for this vulnerable population. This work elucidates novel dependencies among language, emotion, and health. This work identifies resilience factors and probes the translational value of LD.

Objective: The goal of this study was to predict the time it took for patients with severe depressive disorders at Jimma University Medical Center to experience their initial symptomatic recovery. Study design: The researchers utilized a prospective study design. Methods: Patients with major depressive disorder were followed up on at Jimma University Medical Center from September 2018 to August 2020 for this study. The Gamma and Inverse Gaussian frailty distributions were employed with Weibull, Log-logistic, and Log-normal as baseline hazard functions. Akaike Information Criteria were used to choose the best model for describing the data. Results: This study comprised 366 patients, with 54.1% of them experiencing their first symptomatic recovery from a severe depressive disorder. The median time from the onset of symptoms to symptomatic recovery was 7 months. In the study area, there was a clustering effect in terms of time to first symptomatic recovery from major depressive disorder. According to the Log-normal Inverse-Gaussian frailty model, marital status, chewing khat, educational status, work status, substance addiction, and other co-variables were significant predictors of major depressive disorder (p-value < 0.05). Conclusion: The best model for describing the time to the first symptomatic recovery of major depressive disorder is the log-normal Inverse-Gaussian frailty model. Being educated and working considerably were the variables that reduces the time to first symptomatic recovery from major depressive disorder; whereas being divorced, chewing khat, substance abused and other co-factors were the variables that significantly extends the time to first symptomatic recovery.
