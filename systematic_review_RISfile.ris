AB  - Workaholism is a current issue in modern organizations with well-characterized implications for individual health and well-being. Yet, the affective experience of workaholics at work and their emotional reactivity to job stressors have been poorly investigated, with the few available studies being cross-sectional or based on retrospective reports obtained outside the working time. Here, we conducted an experience sampling study to characterize workaholics’ affective experience during work and their emotional reactivity to workday accumulation and momentary workload. A total of 139 full-time back-office workers participated in a 3-day protocol by reporting on their hedonic tone and momentary workload up to six times per workday. Multilevel modeling was used to investigate the relationship between trait workaholism and job-related hedonic tone as well as the cross-level interactions between workaholism and both workday accumulation and momentary workload. As expected, our results showed lower job-related hedonic tone for individuals with higher workaholic tendencies, with workaholism interacting with the two investigated job stressors. However, contrary to our hypotheses, we found that workaholism weakened, rather than strengthening, the negative trend of hedonic tone over the levels of both predictors, a result possibly explained by a blunted reactivity condition due to chronic job strain. Moreover, we corroborated previous findings suggesting worse outcomes in workaholic women compared to workaholic men. Organizations should consider taking action to monitor and manage the workaholism levels in the workforce and to create a psychosocial work environment that discourages the enactment of workaholic tendencies.

AB  - Background: Workaholism is conceptualized as a compulsive need to work incessantly, and it is related to numerous detrimental organizational and individual consequences. For that reason, it is imperative that researchers uncover possible variables that can alleviate its potentially harmful effects. Objective: This study aims to examine the relationship between workaholism, psychological capital (PsyCap), physical health, and work stress. The potential mitigating role that PsyCap could play between workaholism and physical health, as well as work stress, was also examined. Methods: Data on workaholism, PsyCap, physical health, and work stress were collected from 343 full-time faculty and staff from a large Southeastern university. Results: Results showed workaholism negatively related to physical health and positively related to work stress. Additionally, PsyCap had a positive relationship with physical health and a negative relationship with work stress. Moreover, PsyCap moderated the relationship between workaholism and work stress, such that as PsyCap increased, the relationship between workaholism and work stress weakened. Conclusions: PsyCap may be a fairly simple and cost-effective intervention for organizations to implement, as it can be learned through short training sessions. By incorporating PsyCap, organizations may be able to help mitigate levels of stress in their employees, specifically among those who suffer from workaholism.

AB  - Heavy Work Investment (HWI) is a construct that comprises both workaholism and work engagement. We tested a path analysis model on 364 Italian workers, with servant leadership as a predictor of HWI and HWI as a predictor of Organizational Citizenship Behaviors (OCB) and Counterproductive Work Behaviors (CWB). We also performed ANOVAs and MANOVAs. Among the main findings, servant leadership is a positive predictor of both workaholism and work engagement. Work engagement is a positive predictor of OCB and a negative predictor of CWB. Conversely, workaholism, is a positive predictor of CWB, but it does not predict OCB. Hence, we encourage implementing soft-skills interventions aimed at making leaders aware of the different worker types in their organization to develop tailored measures to foster work engagement rather than workaholism. Also, we recommend controlling for work engagement when analyzing workaholism, given the different findings that arose when controlling or not controlling for work engagement.

AB  - La inversión en trabajo pesado (ITP) es un constructo que abarca la adicción al trabajo y la implicación en el mismo. Pusimos a prueba un modelo de análisis de trayectorias con 364 trabajadores italianos utilizando el liderazgo de servicio como predictor de la ITP y esta como predictora a su vez de comportamientos de ciudadanía organizativa (CCO) y de comportamientos contraproductivos en el trabajo (CCT). Llevamos a cabo también ANOVA y MANOVA. Entre los resultados obtenidos está que el liderazgo de servicio predice positivamente el CCO y negativamente la implicación en el trabajo. Por el contrario, la adicción al trabajo predice positivamente el CCT pero no el CCO. De este modo proponemos llevar a cabo intervenciones en destrezas 'blandas', que hagan conscientes a los líderes de los diferentes tipos de trabajadores en su empresa para desarrollar medidas adaptadas, que potencien la implicación en el trabajo antes que la adicción al mismo. También recomendamos que se controle la implicación en el trabajo al estudiar la adicción al mismo, siendo el resultado diferente si ese control se produce o no.

AB  - Introduction: This study aims to examine the association between depression and workaholism among university students. Methods: Participants were 182 undergraduates at a large university in the South of Poland, aged between 20–28 years old (M = 22.17, SD = 1.39), including 102 women (56%). The cross-sectional study used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Work Addiction Risk Test (WART). Results: This study shows that depression and workaholism levels are significantly lower in Physical Education students than other faculties' students. Gender moderates the relationship between workaholism and depression. Women demonstrate a stronger association between depression and workaholism than men. Conclusions: Both physical activity and gender appear to play an essential role in mental health prevention. The result of this study should be considered in therapy and prevention programs at university campuses. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Intense work experiences related not only to flow, but also to workaholism, characterize the work of neurosurgeons, who are professionals at high risk of burnout. The aim of this study was to investigate the combined effects of flow experience and workaholism on burnout among neurosurgery residents. Adopting a person-centered approach, we sought to identify subpopulations of neurosurgery residents with distinct profiles based on their levels of workaholism and flow at work. We then examined the links between these profiles and occupational burnout. Survey data were obtained from 141 residents enrolled on a neurosurgery program in France. Results revealed two profiles that differentiated between individuals with high- versus low-flow experiences, but not with high versus low workaholism scores. As expected, burnout differed significantly between the two profiles: 19.8% of residents with the low flow at work profile had severe overall burnout, compared with just 11.1% with the high flow at work profile, while 37.5% of residents with the low flow at work profile were characterized by high levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, compared with 26.7% with the high flow at work profile. The low flow at work profile was also characterized by higher levels of neuroticism. Results suggest that neurosurgical residents with higher levels of neuroticism experience less flow at work, and are thus less protected from burnout. It is therefore important to investigate these factors in prevention programs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The aim of the present study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Turkish version of the Bergen Work Addiction Scale (BWAS-T). The study sample comprised 448 participants (279 females and 169 males) who completed a survey including the BWAS-T, Workaholism Battery (WorkBAT), Dutch Work Addiction Scale (DUWAS), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS). The Turkish version of BWAS had good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .76). As expected, score on the BWAS-T was positively correlated with scores on the Drive subscale of the WorkBAT and Working Excessively and Working Compulsively subscales of the DUWAS. No relationship was found between the BWAS-T and Work Enjoyment subscale of the WorkBAT. Regarding concurrent validity, scores on the BWAS-T were strongly correlated with those on the DASS and its subscales. The factor structure of the BWAS-T was also tested using confirmatory factor analysis which found support for the original unidimensional factor structure. Results demonstrated that the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the BWAS were robust. Limitations and recommendations for further studies are discussed.

AB  - Although previous research has identified that perfectionism is associated with both narcissism and workaholism, research into the specific roles of potential perfectionism classes in these personality dynamics is currently unavailable. Furthermore, no study has investigated if the 'useless superiority effort' dimension of inferiority feelings, which indicates an increased need for superiority over others potentially to overcome self-perceived inferiorities, is related to other important personality dynamics. This study was therefore conducted to identify if potential perfectionism classes that exist among academicians (N = 317) can simultaneously explain significant differences in their tendencies toward workaholism, narcissism, and useless superiority effort, after controlling for potential social desirability effect. A latent class analysis of two dimensions of perfectionism (discrepancy and high standards) revealed four distinct classes of academicians; non-perfectionists (NONPs; 20%), maladaptive perfectionists (MPs; 17%), normal perfectionists (NPs; 44%) and adaptive perfectionists (APs; 19%). Further analysis (MANCOVA) showed that while MPs have the highest tendencies toward workaholism and useless superiority effort, NONPs have the lowest tendencies toward these. Moreover, APs reported significantly lower useless superiority than NPs, despite scoring similarly on both narcissism and workaholism. Additionally, based on workaholism being related to narcissism, high standards and discrepancy dimensions of perfectionism, as well as useless superiority effort, while weekly work hours are not, it can be suggested that workaholism is qualitatively different from working long hours.

AB  - Addiction to work is defined as a compulsion or an uncontrollable need to work incessantly. Only few measures exist to identify work addiction and the health consequences are sparsely explored. The Bergen Workaholic Scale (BWAS) measures seven core elements of work addiction and has been used in Norway, Hungary, Brazil, Italy, USA and Poland. The aim of this study was to validate the BWAS in a Danish sample and to investigate if high risk of work addiction was associated with stress and reduced quality of life. We conducted an online screening survey with 671 participants aged 16–68 years with the Danish translation of the BWAS. We added the perceived stress scale (PSS) and the quality of life scale EQ‐5D‐5L. Those with high risk of work addiction reported significantly higher mean PSS scores (20.0 points) compared to those with low risk of addiction (12.5 points) and poorer quality of life (61.9) compared to the low risk group (81.3). Furthermore, work addiction was associated with more weekly working hours (44.0 vs. 35.6 hours/week) and having more leadership responsibility. A preliminary estimate of work addiction prevalence was 6.6%. The BWAS demonstrated good reliability (α = 0.83), and factor analyses pointed at a single factor structure. Work addiction seems to be associated with health problems in terms of stress and poorer quality of life. The BWAS is recommended as a reliable and valid tool to identify work addiction in Danish.

AB  - Using smartphone for work in off‐work hours has been associated with negative employee outcomes. We postulate that: (1) organizational norm of connectivity precedes employees' work‐related smartphone use after work, which predicts emotional exhaustion among employees; and (2) this process is moderated by employees' workaholism. We collected data from 399 full‐time employees who completed six online surveys over 3 workdays to test our hypotheses. Multilevel path analysis of these data revealed that organizational norm of connectivity was more strongly related to smartphone use after work among employees with high workaholism compared to those with low workaholism. However, smartphone use was more strongly related to emotional exhaustion among those with low workaholism compared to those with high workaholism. In total, the indirect effect of organizational norm of connectivity on emotional exhaustion through work‐related smartphone use after work was significant only for those with low workaholism. These findings highlight the role of organizational norm of connectivity and individual workaholism in the association of work‐related smartphone use after work and negative employee outcomes. We discussed the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This research relies on complementary variable‐ and person‐centred approaches to investigate the underlying dimensionality of the workaholism construct. In three studies (Study 1: N = 343 workers; Study 2: N = 654 firefighters in Sample 1 and N = 247 administrative and technical employees in Sample 2; and Study 3: N = 153 nurses in Sample 1 and N = 359 educators in Sample 2), the results showed that employees' workaholism ratings simultaneously reflected a global overarching workaholism construct, which co‐existed with two specific dimensions (working excessively and compulsively). In Study 1, global levels of self‐determined motivation were associated with higher global levels of workaholism, whereas perceived supervisor support was negatively related to global levels of workaholism. We then examined the distinct configurations, or profiles, taken by workaholism dimensions (global workaholism, and specific working excessively and compulsively; Studies 2 and 3) and psychological detachment (Study 3). Studies 2 and 3 also documented the associations between these workaholism profiles, and correlated predictor (e.g. supervisor support, workload) and outcome (e.g. emotional exhaustion, work performance) variables. Three of the four profiles identified were similar across studies (Low Global and Average Specific Workaholism,Average Global and Specific Workaholism and High Global and Average Specific Workaholism), whereas one profile was different across studies and samples. In both studies, the High Global and Average Specific Workaholism profile was associated with the worst correlated outcome variables (e.g. high levels of emotional exhaustion, low levels of job satisfaction).

AB  - Studies on bottom-line mentality (BLM) suggest that an exclusive focus on bottom-line outcomes has detrimental consequences; however, it is not clear when this leads to negative outcomes. This study examines the role of supervisors’ BLM in fostering workaholism in subordinates. These supervisors, by creating a bottom-line driven environment, may intensify workaholism, leading to workplace cheating behavior. However, not all subordinates react in the same manner. We theorize that the positive relationship between supervisor BLM and workplace cheating behavior through workaholism is strengthened when the psychological entitlement is high. The moderation-mediation model was tested with data from 193 employees working in various industries. Our findings demonstrate that under conditions of high psychological entitlement, workaholism resulting from supervisor BLM leads to workplace cheating behavior. Implications of these findings have been discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The present study advances a within-person approach to the study of workaholism in line with whole trait theory, arguing that individuals have general workaholic tendencies as well as daily fluctuations in workaholism. We tested this model using an experience sampling study of 121 U.S. employees and their spouses who completed self-report surveys for 10 working days. Multilevel analyses supported the idea that workaholism varies at the daily level, and trait workaholism was significantly related to higher daily fluctuations in workaholism averaged across the 10 days. Consistent with whole trait theory (Fleeson, 2007), we found anticipated workload each morning positively related to daily fluctuations in workaholism. Moreover, individuals reported feeling more fatigued on days they report higher daily workaholism, and daily fluctuations in workaholism were related to stress crossover and spouse’s relationship tension. Overall, results support a within-person conceptualization of workaholism, linking anticipated workload to daily fluctuations in workaholism, which in turn demonstrates negative spillover and crossover outcomes.

AB  - Relationships among workaholism, mindfulness, and negative affect (NA) were examined. Data were collected, through Amazon Mechanical Turk, from 400 working adults in the USA. Workaholism was positively related to weekly hours worked and NA, and mindfulness was negatively related to NA. Additionally, workaholism and weekly hours worked were negatively related to mindfulness. Moreover, mindfulness moderated the relationship between workaholism and NA such that as levels of mindfulness increased, the influence of workaholism on NA decreased. Thus, mindfulness can be developed like a skill through meditation, and it may be established as an intervention for workaholism by reducing the compulsive behavior of workaholics and weakening the relationship with NA.

AB  - This research explored the role of the behavioral (i.e., excessive work) and the cognitive (i.e., compulsive work) dimensions of workaholism in explaining the effects of workload on managers’ work-family conflict and lack of psychological detachment. For this study, data was collected at 2 time points, over a 3-month period, from a sample of 393 French supervisors working in the health care setting. Results from a cross-lagged model based on structural equation modeling indicated that workload positively predicted managers’ tendency to work excessively, but it was not significantly related to their tendency to work compulsively. In turn, working excessively had positive effects on supervisors’ work-family conflict and lack of psychological detachment. Working compulsively did not significantly predict either of these outcomes over time. Overall, these findings shed light on the mechanisms involved in the longitudinal relationship between managers’ work experience and their functioning outside the job. More specifically, this study goes beyond previous research by emphasizing that the 2 dimensions of workaholism have differential antecedents and outcomes over time. Theoretical contributions and perspectives, as well as implications for practice are further discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: In literature, there are many instruments for evaluating workaholism; however, they do not have convergent validity, because of the lack of a shared definition of workaholism. Objective: We propose a new instrument for evaluating workaholism and work engagement, namely the Work-related Inventory (WI-10), which is based on Loscalzo and Giannini’s (2017) comprehensive definition of workaholism. Methods: We developed a pool of 36 items, covering: 1) addiction symptoms; 2) obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and 3) work engagement. Then, we conducted Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor analyses on a sample of 503 Italian workers (165 males, 337 females, one missing; Mean age = 38.26 ± 10.84) aiming to reduce the number of items. Results: The results showed a 10-items (2 filler) and 2-factor solution: 1) Workaholism and 2) Work Engagement; moreover, the WI-10 has good internal reliability, convergent and divergent validity. Conclusions: We found good psychometric properties for the WI-10. We also proposed the cut-off scores for the screening of the four kinds of workers proposed by Loscalzo and Giannini (2017): disengaged workaholics, engaged workaholics, engaged workers, and detached workers. The WI-10 will be useful for both research and preventive and clinical purposes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There are mounting calls for investigating the underlying mechanisms through which workaholism influences job performance and testing multilevel homology of these relationships (i.e., the similarity of the relationships across different levels of analyses). In response to these calls, we examined the mediation roles of workload and emotional exhaustion in the relationship between workaholism and job performance across within-person and between-person levels. To test our hypotheses, we adopted a daily diary design to collect data from a sample of 119 employees over ten consecutive workdays. The results of multilevel analysis indicated that at the within-person level, daily workaholism was directly and indirectly (via daily workload and emotional exhaustion) related to daily performance. At the between-person level, workaholism did not directly affect performance, but indirectly affected performance via workload and emotional exhaustion. At both levels, the indirect effect of workaholism via workload canceled out the indirect effect via emotional exhaustion, resulting in a null indirect effect of workaholism on performance. Finally, this study supported a lack of multilevel homology in the direct and indirect effects of workaholism on job performance across within-person and between-person levels. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed for improving workaholics’ job performance and well-being. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Two studies were conducted to examine the association of two workaholism components (drive to work and work enjoyment) with life and work values. Study 1 examined whether life values that are lower on the ideal value hierarchy predict the drive to work; and whether life values that are higher on the hierarchy predict work enjoyment. Study 2 tested the hypotheses that extrinsic work values predict the drive to work, whereas intrinsic work values predict work enjoyment. The results of study 1 showed that moral values, which represent higher order life values, were negatively correlated with the drive to work and positively correlated with work enjoyment. Work enjoyment was also negatively associated with vital values, which have a low position on the ideal life values hierarchy. Hypotheses about the relationships between the two workaholism components and life and work values were not fully confirmed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Cannabis demand (i.e., relative value), assessed cross-sectionally via a hypothetical marijuana purchase task (MPT), has been associated with use, problems, and dependence symptoms, among others. However, limited work exists on the prospective stability of the MPT. Furthermore, cannabis demand among veterans endorsing cannabis use, and the prospective cyclical relationship between demand and use over time, have yet to be investigated. Method: Two waves of data from a veteran sample (N = 133) reporting current (past 6-month) cannabis use were analyzed to assess stability in cannabis demand over 6 months. Autoregressive cross-lagged panel models (CLPMs) assessed the longitudinal associations between demand indices (i.e., intensity, Omax,Pmax, breakpoint) and cannabis use. Results: Baseline cannabis use predicted greater intensity (β = .32, p < .001), Omax (β = .37, p < .001), breakpoint (β = .28, p < .001), and Pmax (β = .21, p = .017) at 6 months. Conversely, baseline intensity (β = .14, p = .028), breakpoint (β = .12, p = .038), and Pmax (β = .12, p = .043), but not Omax, predicted greater use at 6 months. Only intensity demonstrated acceptable prospective reliability. Conclusions: Cannabis demand demonstrated stability over 6 months in CLPM models, varying along with natural changes in cannabis use. Importantly, intensity, Pmax, and breakpoint displayed bidirectional predictive associations with cannabis use, and the prospective pathway from use to demand was consistently stronger. Test–retest reliability ranged from good to poor across indices. Findings highlight the value of assessing cannabis demand longitudinally, particularly among clinical samples, to determine how demand fluctuates in response to experimental manipulation, intervention, and treatment.

Multiple regression and canonical correlation analysis of 106 participants indicate a significant relationship between personality traits, life balance domains, and work addiction. In particular, neuroticism was positively related to work addiction, as suggested in earlier studies. Among all the life balance domains five of the 10 life balance domains had a significant positive relationship with work addiction: positive orientation, substance use, sleep disturbance, stress/anxiety, and friendship. Results obtained from this study will help career and mental health counselors better understand entrepreneurs’ needs and life balance domains. By identifying neuroticism and stress levels among entrepreneurs, career counselors can better understand work addiction tendencies and use appropriate interventions accordingly.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the way of doing work for the relationship between employees’ perfectionism, type A personality and workaholism during COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 668 Lithuanian employees participated in a study. The sample included employees who worked in the workplace (n = 331), as well as those who worked completely from home (n = 337). The levels of workaholism were measured using DUWAS-10 (Schaufeli et al., 2009). A multidimensional perfectionism scale (Hewitt et al., 1991) was used for the measurement of perfectionism. Type A personality was assessed with the help of the Framingham type A personality scale (Haynes et al., 1980). It was revealed in a study that the positive relationship between perfectionism and work-a-holism was stronger in the group of complete remote workers. It was further found that the moderating role of the way of doing work was not significant for the relationship between type A personality and workaholism. Overall, the findings support the idea that remote work is an important variable determining the development of health-damaging working behaviors among those employees who excel perfectionistic attributes. Therefore, the way of doing work must be considered when addressing the well-being of employees. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)
AB  - Tyrimu siekta nustatyti darbo atlikimo būdo reikšmę ryšiui tarp perfekcionizmo, A tipo asmenybės ir darboholizmo COVID-19 pandemijos metu. 2021 m. vasario–balandžio mėnesiais atliktame tyrime dalyvavo 668 darbuotojai iš įvairių Lietuvos organizacijų. Darboholizmui vertinti naudota trumpoji Schaufeli ir kitų (2009) pasiūlytos skalės versija DUWAS-10. Perfekcionizmui matuoti naudota trumpoji daugiadimensio perfekcionizmo skalės versija (Hewitt et al., 1991). A tipo asmenybės konstrukcijai matuoti naudota Framinghamo A tipo asmenybės skalė (Haynes et al., 1980). Taikant moderacinių ryšių analizę nustatyta, kad darbo atlikimo būdas yra reikšmingas perfekcionizmo ir darboholizmo ryšio moderatorius. Teigiamas ryšys tarp perfekcionizmo ir darboholizmo yra stipresnis nuotolinį darbą dirbančių darbuotojų grupėje. Darbo atlikimo būdo kaip moderatoriaus reikšmė ryšiui tarp A tipo asmenybės konstrukcijos ir darboholizmo nėra statistiškai reikšminga. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this two-wave longitudinal study was to examine the associations between work engagement and workaholism to better understand the psychological mechanisms underpinning high levels of work investment. These associations were examined in a sample of 514 employees using latent change models, allowing us to obtain a direct and explicit estimate of change occurring in both constructs over a 3-year period. These analyses relied on a bifactor representation of work engagement and workaholism, allowing us to properly disaggregate the global and specific levels of both constructs in the estimation of these longitudinal associations. To further enrich our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms at play in these relations, we also considered associations between these two constructs and employees’ levels of harmonious and obsessive work passion, two other facets of heavy work investment. Our results revealed the longitudinal independence of employees’ global levels work engagement and workaholism, showing that longitudinal associations between these two constructs occurred at the specific, rather than global, level. Harmonious work passion was only found to be associated to global and specific components of work engagement, whereas obsessive work passion was found to be associated with global and specific components of both work engagement and workaholism.

AB  - By drawing on effort-recovery theory, we conducted two studies to explore the short-term process through which workaholism may affect health and to assess the implications of such a process for job performance. In Study 1 we hypothesised that workaholic tendencies would affect daily workload and that daily workload would mediate the relationship between workaholic tendencies and daily emotional exhaustion. Data were provided by 102 workers consisting mostly of entrepreneurs, managers and self-employed individuals, who were followed for ten consecutive working days. Multilevel structural equation modelling, controlling for the general level of workload, neuroticism and conscientiousness, supported the hypotheses. Building on the results of Study 1, in Study 2 we hypothesised that workaholism would lead in the long run to a decline in job performance. Study 2 considered 519 employees of a large organisation and focused on their supervisors’ performance ratings in two successive years. Workaholism was used to predict change in work performance. Work engagement was included in the model as a concurrent predictor of work performance. Contrary to what was hypothesised, workaholism did not affect performance; only work engagement did so, and in a positive way. The implications of the obtained results for further research on workaholism are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Alcohol use among correctional workers remains an understudied phenomenon, although recognized in literature as a coping strategy employed by persons in public safety occupations. Moreover, previous literature denotes a prevalence of mental health disorders higher than that of the general population among correctional workers and public safety personnel. In the present study, we examine the prevalence of alcohol use disorders among correctional workers employed in the provincial correctional service in Ontario, Canada (n = 915), to understand the severity of the concern and to explain how alcohol use is associated with diverse mental health concerns. Specifically, we unpack the correlation between problematic alcohol use, mental health disorders, and suicide behaviours among this correctional worker population, finding that the prevalence of mental health disorders and suicide thoughts and behaviours was higher for persons reporting problematic alcohol use. Discussion includes recommendations on research needs tied to unpacking the relationship, including causal relationship between alcohol use and mental health, as a way to combat the devastating realities tied to compromised mental health endured by employees in correctional services. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)
AB  - We found relatively low prevalence of alcohol use disorder among provincial correctional workers, which suggests that perhaps awareness of the impacts of addiction given their work with criminalized people may be affecting alcohol use. However, mental health disorders and suicide behaviours were strongly associated with alcohol use disorders, indicating that improving the mental health and well-being of correctional workers remains an important public health priority. More needs to be done to disambiguate the comorbidity between alcohol use disorder and other mental health disorders among correctional workers.

AB  - La consommation d’alcool chez les travailleurs correctionnels reste un phénomène peu étudié, bien qu’elle soit reconnue dans la littérature comme une stratégie d’adaptation employée par les personnes travaillant dans le domaine de la sécurité publique. En outre, la littérature antérieure fait état d’une prévalence des troubles mentaux supérieure à celle de la population générale chez les travailleurs correctionnels et le personnel de la sécurité publique. Dans la présente étude, nous examinons la prévalence des troubles liés à la consommation d’alcool chez les travailleurs correctionnels du service correctionnel provincial de l’Ontario, au Canada (n = 915), afin de comprendre la gravité du problème et d’expliquer comment la consommation d’alcool est associée à divers problèmes de santé mentale. Plus précisément, nous analysons la corrélation entre la consommation problématique d’alcool, les troubles de santé mentale et les comportements suicidaires au sein de cette population d’employés des services correctionnels, en constatant que la prévalence des troubles de santé mentale et des pensées et comportements suicidaires est plus élevée chez les personnes qui déclarent une consommation problématique d’alcool. La discussion comprend des recommandations sur les besoins de recherche liés à l’analyse de la relation, y compris la relation de cause à effet entre la consommation d’alcool et la santé mentale, comme moyen de lutter contre les réalités dévastatrices liées à la mauvaise santé mentale des employés des services correctionnels.

AB  - Scholarly interest in workaholism has increased dramatically in recent years. This research has underscored the detrimental effects of workaholism for employees, their families, and the organizations that employ them. Despite drastic improvements in the quality of studies examining workaholism over the past several decades, researchers continue to almost exclusively rely on older measures of workaholism or new measures derived from these original measures. In the present study, we outline why a new measure is needed and propose a multidimensional conceptualization of workaholism that encompasses motivational, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions. We then develop and validate a new multidimensional measure of workaholism: the Multidimensional Workaholism Scale (MWS). Evidence from 5 samples representing individuals working in a wide variety of occupations and industries throughout the United States (total N = 1,252) provides support that (a) our proposed 4-factor structure replicates and fits better than alternative models; (b) the measure demonstrates high reliability and content validity; (c) the measure demonstrates evidence for convergent and discriminant validity with constructs in workaholism’s nomological network; (d) the measure demonstrates incremental validity in the prediction of important outcomes over and above prior measures of workaholism; and (e) the different dimensions demonstrate incremental validity in the prediction of specific outcomes over and above other dimensions of the MWS. Overall, results from the present study suggest that the MWS is a reliable and valid measure that can advance a more nuanced approach to research and practice relating to workaholism.

AB  - The literature has widely focused on the link between workaholism and wellbeing. However, potential moderators of this relationship—facilitators or buffers—have rarely been studied. This study investigates the mediating role of work–family conflict (WFC) on the relationship between workaholism and employee wellbeing and the moderating role of instrumental spousal support on this mediated model. The sample includes 244 dual-earner employees in various sectors. Drawing on the effort–recovery model and the conservation of resources theory, our model posits that the mediating effect of WFC on the linkage between workaholism and employee wellbeing is contingent upon the levels of instrumental support. According to the moderated mediation analysis, WFC transmits the effects of workaholism on wellbeing and assumes a mediator role only when the employee perceives a low or medium level of instrumental spousal support. This highlights the importance of instrumental spousal support in decreasing the detrimental effects of workaholism and WFC on wellbeing. Instrumental spousal support seems to decrease the plausible effect of workaholism by reducing the perceived seriousness of family-related burdens. Thus, employees receiving spousal support are more likely to feel assisted and confident that their responsibilities at home will be met. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine, with a longitudinal design, the moderating role of workload in the relationship between perfectionism and workaholism. It was hypothesized that self-oriented perfectionism (SOP) and socially prescribed perfectionism (SPP) predict an increase in workaholism and that workload may exacerbate this association. Four hundred and thirty workers completed a self-report questionnaire at two different time points, and the hypothesized relationships were tested using structural equation modeling. Overall, SOP and SPP were not associated with workaholism over time. The interaction between SOP, but not SPP, and workload was significant. SOP predicted an increase in workaholism over time in workers facing high workload. Accordingly, SOP may be a risk factor for workaholism when workload is high.

AB  - Despite the relatively intuitive link between working hard and achievements at work, results from empirical studies tend to characterize workaholics more often as hard workers rather than smart workers. Indeed, the link between workaholism and job performance is not obvious. In this paper, we investigated the link between workaholism and a core component of contextual performance, namely, prosocial organizational citizenship behavior (P-OCB). More in detail, we posited a mediational model in which workaholic tendencies negatively predicted P-OCB indirectly through an increased perception of job demands. This model was tested using longitudinal data from a sample of 85 police officers assessed once every two weeks for three months. Results from multilevel structural equation analyses demonstrated the model's good fit and corroborated the mediated effect. All in all, our results point to an organizational cost of workaholism, represented by its aversive impact on P-OCB. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Despite the many number of studies examining workaholism, large-scale studies have been lacking. The present study utilized an open web-based cross-sectional survey assessing symptoms of psychiatric disorders and workaholism among 16,426 workers (Mage = 37.3 years, SD = 11.4, range = 16–75 years). Participants were administered the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale, the Obsession-Compulsive Inventory-Revised, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Bergen Work Addiction Scale, along with additional questions examining demographic and work-related variables. Correlations between workaholism and all psychiatric disorder symptoms were positive and significant. Workaholism comprised the dependent variable in a three-step linear multiple hierarchical regression analysis. Basic demographics (age, gender, relationship status, and education) explained 1.2% of the variance in workaholism, whereas work demographics (work status, position, sector, and annual income) explained an additional 5.4% of the variance. Age (inversely) and managerial positions (positively) were of most importance. The psychiatric symptoms (ADHD, OCD, anxiety, and depression) explained 17.0% of the variance. ADHD and anxiety contributed considerably. The prevalence rate of workaholism status was 7.8% of the present sample. In an adjusted logistic regression analysis, all psychiatric symptoms were positively associated with being a workaholic. The independent variables explained between 6.1% and 14.4% in total of the variance in workaholism cases. Although most effect sizes were relatively small, the study’s findings expand our understanding of possible psychiatric predictors of workaholism, and particularly shed new insight into the reality of adult ADHD in work life. The study’s implications, strengths, and shortcomings are also discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The Generalised Anxiety Disorder Dimensional Scale is a new measure of generalised anxiety disorder developed to assist clinicians in the dimensional assessment of generalised anxiety disorder by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (Fifth Edition) Anxiety, Obsessive- Compulsive Spectrum, Posttraumatic, and Dissociative Disorder Work Group. This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of the scale in an Australian community sample. A sample of 293 Australians (72.7% female) aged between 18 and 73 (M = 28.31 years; SD = 12.11 years) was recruited. Participants completed the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Dimensional Scale, as well as related measures used to assess convergent and discriminant validity. A small proportion of the sample (n = 21) completed the scale a second time to assess test-retest reliability. The scale demonstrated a unidimensional factor structure, good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .94), good test-retest reliability (ICC = .85), good convergent validity with the Generalised Anxiety Disorder– 7 item (rs = .77), and discriminant validity with the Panic Disorder Severity Scale–Self Report (rs = .63). The scale appears to be a reliable and valid measure of generalised anxiety disorder symptomology for use in the Australian population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A new measure of workaholism, the Workaholism Analysis Questionnaire (WAQ), was created and validated in a heterogeneous sample of working professionals. The WAQ demonstrated strong internal reliability, convergent validity, concurrent validity, discriminant validity, and content validity. This is the first study to create a measure of workaholism that was psychometrically tested on a heterogeneous working population. Furthermore, the WAQ is the first measure to define workaholism more broadly and provide a more comprehensive assessment by including items that directly tap into work-life imbalance, a common symptom of workaholism and other addictive disorders.

AB  - Background: It has been documented that social media addiction (SMA) has a detrimental effect on college students’ academic engagement. However, the mechanisms underlying this association are not well understood. This study aimed to determine the serial mediation effects of sleep quality and fatigue on the relationship between SMA and academic engagement among college students. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 2661 college students (43.3% males, mean age = 19.97 years). The participants completed the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, the Utrecht Student Work Engagement Scale for Students, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Fatigue Assessment Scale. The serial mediation effects were examined using Model 6 in the Hayes’ PROCESS macro for SPSS. Results: The results showed that SMA among college students had a direct negative relationship with their academic engagement (Effect = − 0.051, 95% CI: −0.087 to − 0.015). In addition, sleep quality and fatigue mediated the relationship between SMA and academic engagement both independent and serially, with the independent mediation effect of sleep quality being − 0.031 (95% CI: −0.048 to − 0.016), the independent mediation effect of fatigue being − 0.109 (95% CI: −0.133 to − 0.088), and the serial mediation effect of sleep quality and fatigue being − 0.080 (95% CI: −0.095 to − 0.066). The total indirect effect of the three mediation paths was 80.9%. Conclusions: Decreased academic engagement caused by SMA can be aggravated by poor sleep quality and fatigue. Strengthening supervision and intervention in social media use among college students, supplemented by attention to psychosomatic health, including sleep quality and fatigue could promote their engagement in academic work.

AB  - Background: To learn about the experiences of people who use drugs, specifically opioids, in the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM), in Nova Scotia, Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic through qualitative interviews with people who use drugs and healthcare providers (HCP). This study took place within the HRM, a municipality of 448,500 people [1]. During the pandemic many critical services were interrupted while overdose events increased. We wanted to understand the experiences of people who use drugs as well as their HCPs during the first year of the pandemic. Methodology: We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 13 people who use drugs and 6 HCPs, including physicians who work in addiction medicine (3), a pharmacist, a nurse, and a community-based opioid agonist therapy (OAT) program staff member. Participants were recruited within HRM. Interviews were held via phone or videoconference due to social distancing directives. Interviews focused on the challenges people who use drugs and HCPs faced during the pandemic as well as elicited perspectives on a safe supply of drugs and the associated barriers and facilitators to the provision of a safe supply. Results Of the 13 people who use drugs who participated in this study, ages ranged from 21–55 years (mean 40). Individuals had spent on average 17 years in HRM. Most people who use drugs (85%, n = 11) utilized income assistance, the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit, or disability support. Many had experienced homelessness (85%, n = 11) and almost half (46%, n = 6) were currently precariously housed in the shelter system. The main themes among interviews (people who use drugs and HCPs) were housing, accessing healthcare and community services, shifts in the drug supply, and perspectives on safe supply. Conclusions: We identified several challenges that people who use drugs face in general, but especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Access to services, housing support, and interventions to use safely at home were limited. As many challenges faced by people who use drugs exist outside of COVID-19, we concluded that the formal and informal interventions and changes in practice that were made to support people who use drugs should be sustained well past the end of the pandemic. The need for enhanced community supports and a safe supply of drugs, despite its complicated nature, is essential for the health and safety of people who use drugs in HRM, especially during COVID-19.

AB  - Research into 'workaholism' has substantially increased over the last decade, but little effort has been put into assessing work-related correlates. In the present study, 1,608 employees (Mage = 45.2 years, range = 21–60) participated in a nationally representative cross-sectional survey in Norway examining whether job demands, job control, role ambiguity, role conflict, exposure to negative acts, and leadership styles could explain variance in workaholism. The independent variables explained 28% of the variance. Demands, role conflict, and negative acts contributed substantially. Workaholism increased more strongly with increasing demands for workers reporting high control than for those reporting low control. The prevalence of workaholism was 7.3%. Study implications, strengths, and limitations are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Mostly successful people experience feelings of being incompetent throughout their career. These recurrent feelings of being incompetent and not worthy of achievement were termed as impostor feelings by Clance and Imes (1978). The present paper aimed to explore the predictive role of workaholism and self-concept in impostor feelings among employees. A sample of 317 employees (doctors, university teachers, lawyers, bankers, & nurses) from various organizations was approached through convenient sampling method for this research. Validated Urdu translated versions of Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (Clance, 1985), Dutch Workaholism Scale (Schaufeli, Shimazu, & Taris, 2009), and Six Factor Self-concept Scale (Stake, 1994) were administered along with a demographic sheet. Pearson Product-Moment correlation and step wise multiple regression was used to analyze the data. Results showed that negative self-concept is the most significant predictor for impostor feelings followed by workaholism. Regarding the applications of the current study it is suggested on the bases of findings that organizations should work on the self-concept of employees in order to avoid the negative consequences of negative self-concept in the form of impostor feelings which can further impact individual’s and organization’s performance and outcomes.

AB  - Job crafting refers to the proactive actions employees take to redesign their jobs in order to get a better fit with their competencies, expectations, and wishes. So far, little is known about job crafting's underlying mechanisms. In this study, we examine how two different states of affective well‐being (workaholism and work engagement) relate to job crafting 3 months later and how these well‐being states steer different self‐management behaviours, which ultimately lead to job crafting. Structural equation modelling on a heterogeneous sample (N = 287) revealed that work engagement and workaholism both relate to expansive job crafting through different self‐management strategies. Work engagement relates to challenge and resource seeking via self‐goal setting and self‐observation strategies, whereas workaholism associates with challenge and resource seeking only through self‐goal setting. In addition, the results show a strong relationship between workaholism and self‐punishment. Altogether, the findings suggest that self‐management strategies can function as an explanatory mechanism for different job crafting behaviours.

AB  - Gender and Sexuality Center (GSC) professionals experience marginalization in their work and identities and therefore develop strategies to resist this continued marginalization. Using interview data with 13 trans GSC professionals, we explored how trans leaders experience identity and institutional environments working within college and university GSC spaces. We viewed participants’ experiences through critical conceptual frameworks of compulsory heterogenderism and the traditionally heterogendered institution. The research illustrates how trans-identified GSC leaders resist bureaucratic systems in their praxis, navigate their identity, and work within genderist institutional climates. Findings reveal important implications for how trans leaders find support in their work, noting frequent experiences of compulsory heterogenderism and genderist assumptions about their identity and work within college and university GSC spaces. Implications for research uncover a continued need for deeper exploration of trans experiences in higher education to advance equitable working environments for these higher education leaders.

AB  - The overarching aim is to explore what teachers perceive as the opportunities provided by using literature in ethics education in compulsory school. When being interviewed, in what ways do the teachers express views on the potential of fiction to encourage students to accept certain human conditions as imaginable, or to create motivation for ethical change, by means of the capacity of fiction to evoke feelings? Also, in what ways do the teachers interviewed consider fiction to be useful for evoking thoughts about how something could have turned out, in situations that are morally complex? What makes compassion grow within human beings are linked in this article to the concepts as is and as if in play research (cf). Analytical tools are developed and used to explain how, and why, the use of literature is suitable for work with ethics in compulsory school.

AB  - Background: A worker’s work habits can affect their health, both physically and psychologically. Negative results have been associated with work demands (stress, anxiety and depression). Objective: In the present research we carried out a predictive study of work addiction by applying three questionnaires on depression and anxiety. Methods: In this study, the participants were 332 workers, obtained through non-probabilistic sampling. The FACTOR (version 7.2) and SPSS 23.0 programs were used. Results: The results of the correlation analysis show both positive and negative associations with the variables studied. We conclude that work addiction variables can predict anxiety and depression because we found that two variables predict 18.3% of depression and 20.3% of anxiety, which are feelings generated by work and excessive work. Conclusions: It can be concluded that feelings generated by work and excessive work predict anxiety and depression, thus the present research helps to broaden knowledge on work addiction, promoting a healthy lifestyle and prevent absenteeism.

AB  - Inaction inertia is the tendency to forego an opportunity after missing a significantly better opportunity. We show that inaction inertia is rooted in reference dependence. This is consistent with prior work finding that smaller discounts are devalued and inertia is motivated by avoidance of loss. We further illuminate the process by showing that consumers treat the missed discount (rather than the regular price) as a reference point relative to which a smaller discount feels like a loss. Missing a significantly better deal causes people to focus first and foremost on thoughts critical of the current deal. Notably, consumers who miss a smaller discount also construe the second deal as a loss, even if they take it. This research integrates inaction inertia and reference dependence theory using query theory analysis to contextualize inaction inertia with biases such as loss aversion, anchoring, and the default effect.

AB  - Objective: The loss of a spouse is considered one of the most significant life change-related stressors. Bereaved spouses have significantly increased risk of chronic inflammation, and ultimately greater morbidity and mortality. High levels of proinflammatory cytokines are related to negative health outcomes. In bereavement, the ability to successfully regulate emotion is a vital skill for healthy coping and may represent a key psychological mechanism accounting for varying degrees of resilience. Psychological distancing is a frequently adaptive emotion regulation strategy in which an individual appraises a negative situation by taking a step back and distancing oneself, and coolly evaluates what is happening. The objective of the present work was to investigate whether psychological distancing, implemented implicitly via natural language use (i.e., linguistic distancing [LD]), is related to inflammation and bereavement-related health indicators. Method: Participants (N = 144) underwent a blood draw for the inflammation assay, completed questionnaire measures evaluating grief symptoms and health, and completed an oral task describing their relationship with their deceased spouse, which was used for the lexical analyses. Results: We found that LD was significantly associated with a panel of a priori proinflammatory stimulated cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-17A, and IL-2), bereavement-related health indices, and the relationship between grief symptoms and inflammation varied depending on the participants’ implementation of LD. Conclusions: LD may have a buffering effect for this vulnerable population. This work elucidates novel dependencies among language, emotion, and health. This work identifies resilience factors and probes the translational value of LD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The current study examined the mediating effect of presenteeism and moderating effect of managerial support in the relation between workaholism and work–family conflict. A sample of 1065 white‐collar employees from an Italian company filled in an online survey and hypotheses were tested using a bootstrapping procedure. Results showed that presenteeism mediated the association between workaholism and work–family conflict. Moreover, the mediating effect of presenteeism was moderated by managerial support: for employees reporting lower levels of support workaholism was stronger related to presenteeism than for those experiencing higher support. Presenteeism, in turn, was related to greater levels of work–family conflict. The present study sheds light into the protective role played by managerial support in preventing workaholic employees from forcing themselves to attend work also when feeling sick. Accordingly, early intervention aimed at buffering the negative association between workaholism and work–family conflict should focus on training managers to develop supportive leadership skills.

AB  - Introduction: The purpose of this study was to analyze the role of general and occupational stress in the relationship between workaholism (recognized in two ways: as addiction and as behavioral tendency) and the intensity of work-family and family-work conflict. Materials and Methods: The study included 178 working people. The survey was conducted at three stages—half a year before a holiday, right after the holiday and half a year after the holiday. The Excessive Work Involvement Scale (SZAP) by Golińska for the measurement of workaholism recognized as addiction; The Scale of Workaholism as Behavioral Tendencies (SWBT) by Mudrack and Naughton as adapted by Dudek et al for the measurement of workaholism as behavioral tendency; the Perceived Stress Scale by Cohen et al., as adapted by Juczyński for the measurement of general stress; the Scale of Occupational Stress by Stanton in the adaptation of Dudek and Hauk for measurement of occupational stress; the Scale of Work-Family Conflict WFC/FWC by Netemeyer et al. with the Polish adaptation of A.M. Zalewska. Workaholism was measured once—before a holiday, the explained and intervening variables (the level of conflicts and stress, respectively) were measured at three stages. To test the mediating role of general and occupational stress, hierarchical regression analysis as well as the method of bootstrapping were applied. Results and Conclusions: Our results indicate that general stress is an important mediator of the relationship between workaholism recognized as an addiction and work-family conflicts. Occupational stress turned out to be the only mediator in the relationship between workaholism (recognized as an addiction) and the work-family conflict, noted exclusively in the first stage of the study. Both general and occupational stress were not significant mediators in the relationship between workaholism recognized as a behavioral tendency and the conflicts described.

AB  - In order to explain the diverging well-being outcomes of workaholism, this study aimed to examine the motivational orientations that may fuel the two main components of workaholism (i.e. working excessively and working compulsively). Drawings on Self-Determination Theory, both autonomous and controlled motivation were suggested to drive excessive work, which therefore was expected to relate positively to both well-being (i.e. vigor) and ill-health (i.e. exhaustion). Compulsive work, in contrast, was hypothesised to originate exclusively out of controlled motivation and therefore to only associate positively with ill-being. Structural equation modeling in a heterogeneous sample of Belgian white-collar workers (N = 370) confirmed that autonomous motivation associated positively with excessive work, which then related positively to vigor. Controlled motivation correlated positively with compulsive work, which therefore related positively with exhaustion. The hypothesised path from controlled motivation to exhaustion through excessive work was not corroborated. In general, the findings suggest that primarily compulsive work yields associations with ill-being, since it may stem from a qualitatively inferior type of motivation.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to determine the role of personality factors and perfectionism in predicting workaholism among the faculty members. Methods: The design of the study was correlational and the statistical population included faculty members of Islamic Azad University of East Azarbaijan Province, where 278 persons were selected among them using multistage cluster sampling method. The data were collected using a questionnaire on demographic and occupational characteristics, NEO five-factor inventory, and workaholism risk inventory and were analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficients and hierarchical regression analysis. Results: The results of regression analysis showed that by controlling demographic and occupational characteristics, personality factors of conscientiousness (β = 0.52), neurosis (β = −0.38), extraversion (β = 0.23), openness (β = 0.18) and perfectionism (β = 0.43) were able to predict 43% of the workaholism variance among the faculty members. Conclusions: According to the results of this study, personality factors can predict workaholism among university faculty members. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Virtually all studies on workaholism and engagement – two forms of heavy work investment – rely on self-part questionnaires. However, the limitations of self-reports are widely acknowledged and in their final sections, papers on workaholism and engagement typically lament the use of such measures. Investigating data other than respondents’ self-reports, such as peer ratings, may overcome these limitations. Using a sample of 73 dyads composed of focal workers and their colleagues, the present study aimed: (1) to compare focal workers’ and coworkers’ perceptions concerning their levels of work engagement and workaholism; and (2) to explore the discriminant validity of engagement and workaholism. A multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) matrix and a correlated trait-correlated method model, the CT-C(M-1) model, were examined. Our results showed a considerable agreement between both raters (i.e., focal workers and coworkers) in levels of engagement and workaholism. In contrast to previous findings, a significant difference between raters on the cognitive dimension of workaholism (i.e., working compulsively) was observed. Moreover, our results provided further evidence for the discriminant validity between the two forms of heavy work investment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Major Depressive Disorder is one of the most common mental disorders, and it is the main cause of disability worldwide with a prevalence ranging from 7 to 21%. Objective: The goal of this study was to predict the time it took for patients with severe depressive disorders at Jimma University Medical Center to experience their initial symptomatic recovery. Study design: The researchers utilized a prospective study design. Methods: Patients with major depressive disorder were followed up on at Jimma University Medical Center from September 2018 to August 2020 for this study. The Gamma and Inverse Gaussian frailty distributions were employed with Weibull, Log-logistic, and Log-normal as baseline hazard functions. Akaike Information Criteria were used to choose the best model for describing the data. Results: This study comprised 366 patients, with 54.1% of them experiencing their first symptomatic recovery from a severe depressive disorder. The median time from the onset of symptoms to symptomatic recovery was 7 months. In the study area, there was a clustering effect in terms of time to first symptomatic recovery from major depressive disorder. According to the Log-normal Inverse-Gaussian frailty model, marital status, chewing khat, educational status, work status, substance addiction, and other co-variables were significant predictors of major depressive disorder (p-value < 0.05). Conclusion: The best model for describing the time to the first symptomatic recovery of major depressive disorder is the log-normal Inverse-Gaussian frailty model. Being educated and working considerably were the variables that reduces the time to first symptomatic recovery from major depressive disorder; whereas being divorced, chewing khat, substance abused and other co-factors were the variables that significantly extends the time to first symptomatic recovery.

AB  - Research is needed to understand the effects that perfectionism may have in the occupational sector and whether its implications vary cross-nationally. In the current study the relationship of perfectionism on workaholism and work engagement was assessed through multiple groups structural equations models to compare strengths of association in the two countries after measurement invariance was examined for the measures in a sample of 804 U.S. and Italian participants. Evidence of similarities but also some differences were found between the countries. In particular, perfectionistic strivings was similarly related to workaholism in both the countries, whereas it was more strongly related to work engagement in Italy than in U.S. A statistically significant difference for work engagement (Italians more engaged that Americans) was also found, whereas no differences were found for workaholism. Cross-sectional nature of the study and culture used as a proxy is the main limitations. However, the cross-cultural approach adopted in the current study allowed us to report that evidence provided in a country might not be directly applied to another country, even if cultures are quite similar.

AB  - 'Are workaholics born or made?' The current research aims to answer the question above, while investigating the joint impact of internal and external factors (Work Drive and Work Enjoyment) related to workaholism’s dimensions. In Study 1, we hypothesize an order of precedence between those dimensions, utilizing one moderator (Job Autonomy) and one mediator (Work-Family Conflict—WFC) (158 employees). Study 2 (349 employees) expands the general framework, taking two moderators (Self-Criticism and LMX) into consideration. Multivariate (vs. bivariate) analyses allowed more thorough understanding of workaholism and its dimensions. We offer theoretical and practical implications.

AB  - '¿Los adictos al trabajo nacen o se hacen?' Este trabajo trata de contestar dicha pregunta investigando la repercusión conjunta de factores internos y externos (la motivación por el trabajo y el disfrute del mismo) en relación a las dimensiones de la adicción al trabajo. En el estudio 1 se plantea la hipótesis de un orden de precedencia entre esas dimensiones usando un moderador (la autonomía en el puesto de trabajo) y un mediador (el conflicto trabajo-familia) en una muestra de 158 empleados. El estudio 2, en una muestra de 349 empleados, amplía el marco general teniendo en consideración dos moderadores (autocrítica e intercambio líder-subordinado). Los análisis multivariable (en relación a los bivariable) permitieron una mayor comprensión de la adicción al trabajo y de sus dimensiones. Por último, se abordan implicaciones teóricas y prácticas.

AB  - The present series of studies examines how the two dimensions of workaholism (working excessively and compulsively) combine within different profiles of workers. This research also documents the relations between these workaholism profiles and a series of correlates (psychological need thwarting) and adaptive and maladaptive work outcomes. In addition, this research investigates the role of emotional dissonance and employees' perceptions of their workplaces' psychosocial safety climate (Study 1, n = 465), as well as job demands, resources, and perfectionism (Study 2, n = 780) in the prediction of profile membership. Latent profile analysis revealed four identical workaholism profiles in both studies. In Study 1, emotional dissonance predicted a higher likelihood of membership in the Very High, Moderately High, and Moderately Low profiles relative to the Very Low profile. In contrast, Study 2 revealed a more diversified pattern of predictions. In both studies, levels of need thwarting were the highest in the Very High and Moderately High profiles, followed by the Moderately Low profile, and finally by the Very Low profile. Finally, in both studies, the most desirable outcomes levels (e.g., lower levels of work–family conflict and emotional exhaustion, and higher levels of perceived health) were associated with the Very Low profile, followed by the Moderately Low profile, then by the Moderately High profile, and finally by the Very High profile. Practitioner points The most desirable outcomes are associated with the profile characterized by the lowest levels of workaholism. Emotional dissonance predicts a lower likelihood of membership in the profile characterized by the lowest levels of workaholism. Levels of need thwarting are the lowest in the Very Low workaholism profile. High levels of socially prescribed perfectionism are associated with an increased likelihood of membership into the Very High workaholism profile. Reducing emotional dissonance, need thwarting, and socially prescribed perfectionism may help to reduce workaholism, in turn leading to more positive outcomes.

AB  - Work addiction (‘workaholism’) has become an increasingly studied topic in the behavioral addictions literature and had led to the development of a number of instruments to assess it. One such instrument is the Bergen Work Addiction Scale (BWAS—Andreassen et al. 2012 Scandinavian Journal of Psychology, 53, 265-272). However, the BWAS has never been investigated in Eastern-European countries. The goal of the present study was to examine the factor structure, the reliability and cut-off scores of the BWAS in a comprehensive Hungarian sample. This study is a direct extension of the original validation of BWAS by providing results on the basis of representative data and the development of appropriate cut-off scores. The study utilized an online questionnaire with a Hungarian representative sample including 500 respondents (F = 251; Mage = 35.05 years) who completed the BWAS. A series of confirmatory factor analyses were carried out leading to a short, 7-item first-order factor structure and a longer 14-item seven-factor nested structure. Despite the good validity of the longer version, its reliability was not as high as it could have been. One-fifth (20.6 %) of the Hungarians who used the internet at least weekly were categorized as work addicts using the BWAS. It is recommended that researchers use the original seven items from the Norwegian scale in order to facilitate and stimulate cross-national research on addiction to work.

AB  - Past research suggests gender differences in workaholism might be due to differences in how men and women respond to the item content in workaholism measures. Using item response theory differential item functioning, we show women are less likely to report some workaholism items, leading to contamination. Specifically, women are less likely to report spending more time at work than other activities, and staying at work longer than others. We speculate that societal norms and practical restrictions on women's time results in lower endorsement rates for these items compared to men, and thus underestimates their workaholism. Results contradict past findings that men and women are similar in regard to workaholism and suggest women are in fact higher in workaholism than men. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to translate Dutch Workaholism Scale (DUWAS; Schaufeli, Shimazu, & Taris, 2009) in to Urdu language and to establish construct validity of the scale in Pakistani culture. For this purpose study was completed in two phases. In the first phase of the study DUWAS was translated in to Urdu through back translation method following the steps suggested by Sousa and Rojjanasrirat (2011). For the purpose of establishing construct validity of DUWAS, in the second phase of the study data was collected from 317 working men (n = 194) and women (n = 123) of different occupations including doctors, university teachers, lawyers, bankers, and nurses. Data was collected through convenient sampling from KPK (Peshawar, Mardan), Rawalpindi, and Islamabad. Before collecting the data participants were informed about the purpose of the study and were asked to sign a consent form. After data collection it was analyzed by using Amos for the purpose of establishing construct validity of Urdu version of DUWAS. Results showed that the Urdu version of original 10 item DUWAS didn’t show good fit. But after the removal of two items (9 and 10) on the basis of poor squared multiple correlations, model showed good fit. Further reliability analysis through SPSS also showed satisfactory values of Cronbach’s alpha. Additionally no gender differences were found as well as no differences among working men and women from different professions were revealed on workaholism. Overall this study helped us to establish a valid and reliable measure for future studies on workaholism in Pakistan using DUWAS. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Recent studies have pointed to a relationship between personality variables, engagement, and the lifestyle of workers with workaholism. Our goal in the present study is to carry out a predictive study of the pre-existing variables for workaholism. Method: The study sample participants were 513 workers (48.1 % men, 51.9 % women), obtained through non-probability sampling. The programmes used were FACTOR (7.2 version) and SPSS 20.0. Results: We found that personality variables such as engagement, self-efficacy, obsessive-compulsive component (ICO), satisfaction with life and lifestyle were predictive of workaholism. Conclusions: Workaholism can, in fact, be predicted through certain variables (personality, engagement, self-efficacy, ICO, satisfaction with life and lifestyle) and hence, the present study contributes to a better understanding of workaholism and to furthering a healthy life style which may be affected by workaholism.

AB  - This study tests the relationships between workaholism (i.e. working excessively and compulsively), sleep problems and cardiovascular risk in 537 employees from five Spanish hospitals. Four types of worker (i.e. workaholics, positive workers, compulsive workers and hard workers) were distinguished, and their health indicators were compared. The results showed that workaholics experienced significantly more sleep problems (i.e. morning tiredness, sleeping while driving and sleeping fewer hours both on weekdays and at weekends, with poorer quality), had higher relative risk scores, and consumed more caffeine and alcohol than the other patterns of worker (positive, compulsive and hard workers). Further analyses revealed that sleep problems fully mediated the relationship between workaholism (i.e. working excessively and compulsively) and cardiovascular risk. The study emphasizes the fact that being a workaholic might be a significant risk factor for having sleep problems and cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The present study tries to gain more insight in workaholism by investigating its antecedents and consequences using the job demands-resources model. Design: We hypothesized that job demands would be positively related to workaholism, particularly when job resources are low. In addition, we hypothesized that workaholism would be positively related to negative outcomes in three important life domains: health, family, and work. Methods: The research involved 617 Italian workers (employees and self-employed). To test the hypotheses we applied structural equation modeling (SEM) and moderated structural equation modeling (MSEM) using Mplus 6. Results: The results of SEM showed a good model where workload, cognitive demands, emotional demands, and customer-related social stressors were positively related to workaholism and work–family conflict (WFC) (partial mediation). Additionally, workaholism was indirectly related to exhaustion and intentions to change jobs through WFC. Moreover, MSEM analyses confirmed that job resources (job security and opportunities for development) buffered the relationship between job demands and workaholism. Particularly, the interaction effects were statistically significant in five out of eight combinations. Conclusions: These findings suggest that workaholism is a function of a suboptimal work environment and predicts unfavorable employee outcomes. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Tobacco addiction is a chronic, relapsing mental disorder characterized by compulsive tobacco seeking and smoking. Current evidence shows that tobacco addiction exerts their initial reinforcing effects by activating reward circuits in the brain, but the causal connectivity among reward circuits is still unclear. Therefore, it is vital to understand how the reward network works to lead to the compulsive smoking behaviour. Method: We applied dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to resting‐state functional magnetic resonance (rs‐fMRI) to characterize changes in effective connectivity (EC) among eight major hubs from reward network between 76 long‐term male smokers and 55 nonsmoking volunteers (matched with age, gender and education). Results: Relative to the healthy controls, long‐term smokers had stronger ECs from the right anterior insula to left ventral striatum, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) to ventral tegmental area (VTA), PCC to left anterior insula, left anterior insula to VTA, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) to PCC and weaker ECs from the VTA to left ventral striatum, right anterior insula to right ventral striatum, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to right anterior insula. Conclusions: Overall, our findings revealed disrupted neural causal interactions among parts of the reward network associated with tobacco addiction, expanding the growing evidence for the potential neurobiological mechanisms of tobacco addiction. We found abnormalities within the mesocorticolimbic system and a top‐down regulation disorder in the dopamine‐dependent process of response inhibition and salience attribution among long‐term smokers, which may facilitate the development of effective therapies in tobacco addiction.

AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic has brought on many changes in Brazil, one of them being many organizations offering employees the option to set up teleworking, which up until that time had not been a common occurrence in the country. This article discusses the compulsory work from home scenario and analyzes the perceptions and experiences of workers who have been forced to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying favorable and unfavorable factors for Quality of Work Life (QWL). We carried out a qualitative research based on Activity-Centered Ergonomics Applied to Quality of Life at Work (AEA_QLW) for twelve workers with varying positions in different public and private sector organizations. We analyzed their perceptions and experiences about working from home based on six categories examined by (AEA_QLW). The results revealed a balance: three of the categories largely concerning well-being (socio-professional relationships, recognition and professional growth, and use of computers) and three other categories largely concerning malaise (working conditions, work organization, and opinions of work), indicating possible focal points for interventions and care in maintaining this type of work. Important issues were discussed such as the lack of distinction between public and private spaces, the characteristics of current performance/fatigue, and the possible repercussions this can have on workers, their health, and on organizations.

AB  - O cenário da pandemia de COVID-19 no mundo trouxe inúmeras mudanças, entre elas, no Brasil, a opção de grande parte das organizações pelo teletrabalho, até então, não muito recorrente no país. Este artigo aborda a situação de quando, compulsoriamente, o trabalho invade a casa e relata a análise das percepções e das vivências de trabalhadores em teletrabalho compulsório, durante o período da pandemia de COVID-19, identificando fatores favoráveis e desfavoráveis à Qualidade de Vida no Trabalho (QVT). Fundamentada na Ergonomia da Atividade Aplicada à Qualidade de Vida no Trabalho – EAA_QVT, foi realizada uma pesquisa qualitativa com doze trabalhadores de diferentes organizações e cargos, dos setores público e privado, levantando suas percepções e vivências acerca do teletrabalho, de acordo com seis categorias teóricas investigadas pela EAA_QVT. Os resultados revelaram um equilíbrio: três categorias com predominância de bem-estar (Relações socioprofissionais, Reconhecimento e crescimento profissional e Uso da informática) e outras três categorias com predominância de mal-estar (Condições de trabalho, organização do trabalho e Sentimentos no trabalho), indicando focos para possíveis intervenções e cuidados no caso da manutenção desta modalidade de trabalho. Foram discutidas questões importantes como a indistinção entre os espaços públicos e privados, as características da atual sociedade do desempenho/cansaço e suas possíveis repercussões para os trabalhadores, sua saúde e as organizações.

AB  - There is an increase of international students studying social work in Australia. Undertaking the compulsory field work component of social work studies can be particularly complex for international students, as they have to acquire an understanding of social work practice, knowledge and skills in a new cultural context. Prior research has highlighted the importance of supporting students and field educators to ensure successful quality learning experiences for international students in social work field education experiences. This paper reports on a subset of 35 international students who responded to a 2019 field education supervision survey in one Australian state, Queensland. The findings highlight that more international than domestic students are placed in placements with external supervision, that the overall the student cohort is younger than domestic students and that more international students reported longer supervision sessions. Despite field placements often being personally challenging international students rated their supervision experiences positively, and highlighted the opportunities it provided for support, learning and professional development. Students recognised that the process helped them understand concepts of critical reflection and an appreciation of the value of supervision and professional support for their ongoing professional development.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between compulsory new ways of working (flexible work design, workplace design at home, advanced information and communication technology [ICT]‐based communications and culture of innovation) and faculty members' innovative work behaviour. The mediating role of work–life balance and employees' satisfaction with new ways of working in the relationship between new ways of working and innovative work behaviour was also examined. Building on established measurement scales, a questionnaire‐based deductive approach was used to collect data. In total, 457 faculty members were randomly selected from universities in countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council. New ways of work and innovative work behaviour were confirmed as multidimensional concepts. The study participants were clustered in three profiles according to their level of perception of the research variables. New ways of working practices apart from advanced ITC‐based communications were significantly positively related to innovative work behaviour, and work–life balance was significantly positively related to satisfaction. Satisfaction with new ways of working and work–life balance is a vital mechanism of innovative work behaviour, and satisfaction mediates work–life balance and innovative work behaviour. Our research theoretically extends understanding of the compulsory new ways of working and innovative work behaviour in higher education institutions. It provides insights into how new ways of working affect innovative behaviour via two mediating mechanisms: work–life balance and satisfaction. This contingent perspective has not yet been explored in prior studies. Educational policy and decision makers can benefit from the results of this study by reorganizing their work activities according to faculty members' need to foster innovative educational solutions.

AB  - This paper explores the experiences of queer workers in the service economy with a focus on hospitality labor. Studies of gender, sexuality and service labor approached mainstream service work as a scene of compulsory heterosexuality, while literature on the position of queer workers has tended to approach work in terms of structural inequalities that prevent queer workers from participating in the labor market, and has therefore focused on notions of diversity and inclusion as frameworks for understanding how the heteronormativity of service relationships can be overcome. This paper shifts focus to examine how queer subjectivities are enacted within the disciplinary requirements of service labor, and on the way that workers negotiate and contest their positioning at work. The paper situates the subjectivities and laboring practices of queer workers at the nexus of tensions between heteronormativity and the politics of diversity in service venues, and examines how workers negotiate and contest their positioning at work. We explore the normativities that shape permissible queer embodiment at work and show how biographical experiences specific to queer workers inform their laboring practices. The paper shows that queer workers in mainstream hospitality venues are enrolled into a specific mode of interactive service labor that capitalizes on their queer biographies, requires highly cultivated relational capacities, and repositions work as a site of political intervention.

AB  - Life balance is indicative of creating and sustaining a meaningful and satisfying quality of living. Contrarily, work addiction is overinvesting in work‐related behaviors, thereby truncating important life‐balance domains. Given a growing body of literature specific to life balance and the increasing incidence of work addiction and burnout among professionals, the authors evaluated life balance and work addiction among 409 professionals in high‐pressure, high‐demand careers. A strong relationship between life‐balance domains and the propensity toward work addiction was noted. Specifically, stress/anxiety and sleep disturbances were identified as work addiction indicators reducing perceptions of life balance. Counselors should assess these critical domains with clients working in high‐pressure, high‐demand careers and be prepared to support these professionals as they restructure their lives to improve life‐balance domains.

AB  - Intercollegiate athletics represent an industry prone to challenges of work addiction and life balance. Work addiction and life balance domains in male and female intercollegiate athletic coaches and administrators (N = 245) were examined using multiple regression analysis. Higher levels of stress/anxiety, sleep disturbance, and career satisfaction and lower levels of quality of relationships and friendships were the strongest predictors of work addiction. Counseling focused on reducing the negative aspects of work addiction, while maintaining job performance, may benefit this population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction: There is a significant shortage of behavioral health providers trained in caring for patients with problematic substance use, particularly within integrated care settings. Method: An innovative addictions nursing subspecialty curriculum was designed by interdisciplinary faculty from psychiatric nursing, family nursing, counseling, and social work and informed by integrated care, addictions, and telehealth competencies. The subspecialty included prevention, treatment, and recovery approaches to care and encouraged enrollment of students from various health-related disciplines to enhance the students’ experiences of integrated care for substance use treatment prior to completion of the program. Results: Subspecialty courses increased the number of advanced practice nurses in the behavioral health care workforce with enhanced knowledge of integrated telehealth substance use treatment. Discussion: Implementation of similar innovative curricula across health disciplines may significantly improve the care delivered to patients with problematic substance use in traditional medical settings.

AB  - Sign- and goal-tracking are behaviors seen in many species when a conditioned stimulus and it’s corresponding unconditioned stimulus are presented at separate locations, and have been the focus of studies on appetitive conditioned and drug dependence. The neurochemical basis of sign-tracking is of interest for both studies of basic conditioning and addiction. In this work, I examined the role of norepinephrine by employing two noradrenergic drugs used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)—(a) atomoxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake blocker, and (b) guanfacine, an α2A-adrenergic receptor agonist. Sprague-Dawley rats were trained using a standard Pavlovian conditioning procedure with a retractable lever as conditioned stimulus and sucrose pellets as unconditioned stimulus. It was found that while atomoxetine reduced both sign- (both doses) and goal-tracking (only at the higher dose), guanfacine did not have any effect on either behavior. While norepinephrine reuptake blocking may be an effective strategy for reducing sign-tracking, manipulation of the α2A-adrenergic receptor appears less viable.

AB  - This study found that a drug used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatment, atomoxetine, reduces sign-tracking, a behavior used as a model of impulsive behavior, but that another drug, guanfacine, does not. Reduction of impulsivity in this fashion may be important in the prevention of relapse into addiction. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Diagnostic guidelines for compulsive sexual behavior disorder note that moral distress related to sexual behavior is not sufficient to receive the diagnosis. Recent work has questioned the uniqueness of moral distress in predicting self-reported feelings of sexual addiction, demonstrating that other so-called addictive behaviors (e.g., gaming and internet use) are well-predicted by moral disapproval of those behaviors. The present work tested if moral incongruence (the interaction of behavioral frequency and moral disapproval of a behavior) is uniquely related to sexual behavior, or if it generalizes to other addictions as well. Method: This work used a large sample (N = 4,363) involving a representative sample of the U.S. population (n = 2,806) and a sample of sports-wagering individuals in the U.S. (n = 1,557). Interactions between moral disapproval and behavioral frequency were tested for several behaviors (i.e., pornography use, gambling, and several substances). Results: The interaction of behavioral frequency and behavioral disapproval (i.e., moral incongruence) predicted self-reported feelings of addiction to pornography and gambling. Moral incongruence was consistently unrelated to self-reported feelings of addiction to tobacco, illicit substances, and prescription drugs. Results regarding alcohol and marijuana were inconclusive. Conclusions: Moral incongruence is clearly a salient factor in understanding compulsive sexual behavior, and it appears to also be salient to gambling disorder. Though moral incongruence does not seem relevant to some substances (i.e., nicotine, prescription drug misuse, or illicit drug use), further research is needed regarding the effect of moral incongruence on self-reported feelings of addiction to alcohol and marijuana.

AB  - The new diagnosis of compulsive sexual behavior disorder in the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases specifically notes that distress related to moral objections about sexual behavior should not be taken as a symptom of the disorder. The present work demonstrates that this caveat is important, as moral beliefs about sexual behavior do influence whether people feel they are addicted to sexual behaviors. However, the present study shows that these moral beliefs also influence feelings of addiction to gambling and, potentially, other addictive behaviors.

AB  - The current study contributes to our understanding of workaholism as a negative construct, and to its measurement by examining the psychometric properties of a short 10-item workaholism scale called DUWAS (Dutch Work Addiction Scale). Confirmatory factor analyses were carried out in a heterogeneous sample of 2,714 employees from the Netherlands (n = 2,164) and Spain (n = 550). The results confirmed the expected two-factor structure of workaholism: working excessively and working compulsively. Moreover, multi-group analyses showed that this two-factor structure was invariant across both countries. Lastly, negative correlations among workaholism and psychosocial well-being (i.e., perceived health and happiness) are indicators of the negative nature of workaholism.

AB  - Large-scale climatic indices are extensively used as predictors of ecological processes, but the mechanisms and the spatio-temporal scales at which climatic indices influence these processes are often speculative. Here, we use long-term data to evaluate how a measure of individual breeding investment (the egg volume) of three long-lived and long-distance-migrating seabirds is influenced by i) a large-scale climatic index (the North Atlantic Oscillation) and ii) local-scale variables (food abundance, foraging conditions, and competition). Winter values of the North Atlantic Oscillation did not correlate with local-scale variables measured in spring, but surprisingly, both had a high predictive power of the temporal variability of the egg volume in the three study species, even though they have different life-history strategies. The importance of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation suggests carry-over effects of winter conditions on subsequent breeding investment. Interestingly, the most important local-scale variables measured in spring were associated with food detectability (foraging conditions) and the factors influencing its accessibility (foraging conditions and competition by density-dependence). Large-scale climatic indices may work better as predictors of foraging conditions when organisms perform long distance migrations, while local-scale variables are more appropriate when foraging areas are more restricted (e.g. during the breeding season). Contrary to what is commonly assumed, food abundance does not directly translate into food intake and its detectability and accessibility should be considered in the study of food-related ecological processes.

AB  - Data were collected from university employees (N = 129) and Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) members (N = 103) to assess the impact of workaholism on work-family conflict, job satisfaction, and perceptions of leisure time. The results, using two different measures of workaholism (Workaholism Battery, Work Addiction Risk Test), indicated that greater scores on the Workaholic Risk Test were significantly related to greater work-family conflict and less gratification with leisure (or nonwork) time. In terms of the Workaholism Battery, high Drive scores were also found to relate to more work-family conflict. However, Work Enjoyment scores were associated with less work-family conflict, as well as greater scores indicative of satisfaction with the job and the work itself. The need to examine various facets of workaholism and implications for organizational interventions are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: The Social Anxiety Disorder Dimensional Scale (SAD‐D) is a 10‐item scale developed by the Diagnostic and StatisticalManual (Fifth Edition) Anxiety, Obsessive‐Compulsive Spectrum, Posttraumatic, and Dissociative Disorder work group to supplement current dichotomous approaches to assessment of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the SAD‐D in an Australian community sample. Methods: Two‐hundred and ninety‐one participants (72.9% female) aged 18‐76 years (M =28.46; SD = 12.30) completed the study. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis indicated support for the unidimensional structure of the SAD‐D (root mean square error of approximation [RMSE] = 0.08; comparative fit index [CFI] = 0.97). The measure demonstrated strong internal consistency (α = 0.94), as well as good divergent validity. The SAD‐D showed excellent test‐retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.93). Conclusions: Overall, the SAD‐D appears to be a brief and reliable measure of SAD symptomatology. Limitations, including the use of a predominantly female convenience sample, and failure to include the mental health and background of the sample, are discussed.

AB  - This research deals with the measurement and consequences of workaholism in the Netherlands. Study 1 describes the development and validation of a Dutch version of Robinson's (1999) Work Addiction Risk Scale (WART). Confirmatory factor analysis (total N = 356) revealed that the factorial structure of the Dutch WART was similar to that of the US original. Study 2 (N = 232) examined whether the Compulsive Tendencies (CT) subscale of the WART could be used as a short measure of workaholism. The overlap between the full 25-item WART and the CT subscale was high, whereas the patterns of correlations with other concepts were very similar. Study 3 (N = 199) tested a process model for the effects of workaholism (i.e., CT) on exhaustion and work-nonwork conflict, showing that workaholism affected these two outcome variables both directly and indirectly (via perceived job demands). It is concluded that: (i) the Dutch version of the WART is very similar to the US original; (ii) the WART and the CT subscale are both valid measures of workaholism; and (iii) workaholism is a potentially important concept in the study of work and stress.

AB  - This study examined correlates of workaholism among 211 Norwegian journalists. Three workaholism types were considered (work enthusiasts, work addicts, enthusiastic addicts) using measures developed by Spence and Robbins (1992). Correlates included a number of personal demographic and work situation characteristics, measures of positive and negative affect, burnout components and absenteeism. Although the three workaholism types were similar on personal and work situation characteristics, work enthusiasts indicated significantly more positive affect and significantly less negative affect, exhaustion and cynicism than one or both of the other workaholism types. The workaholism types did not differ on professional efficacy or absenteeism however. The three workaholism types worked similar hours per week ruling this out as a possible explanation of the findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Individuals with problematic gambling, alcohol and substance use commonly report lower employment rates and more employment-related problems such as job loss, work conflicts and poor performance. Method: A thematic qualitative analysis was conducted to extract employment-related themes from 21 sets of addiction counselors’ case notes of couple therapy sessions (average 10 sessions per case) from a randomized controlled trial of Congruence Couple Therapy (CCT). Case notes were examined for the types of employment issues to answer the research question: What are the interconnections of employment, couple adjustment and addictive behaviors as revealed in the CCT counselors’ case notes? Results: Five key areas of employment-related stress were identified: (1) unemployment, (2) financial concerns, (3) history of crime, (4) overworking and workaholism, and (5) workplace conflict. These themes interacted negatively with couple adjustment and addictive behaviors. Using CCT as an intervention, clients gained skills in 4 areas transferred to employment: (1) awareness of self, other and family of origin, (2) congruent communication, (3) work-family balance, and (4) enlisting spousal support. These themes intersected with enhanced work functioning and reduced stress, alcohol use and gambling. Conclusion: Employment problems negatively impacted addictive behaviors, couple adjustment and well-being of partners and clients. Skills and awareness gained in CCT promoted changes in addicted clients’ employment functioning and coping with employment stress. The domains of work and couple adjustment are mutually influential in increasing or reducing stress with implications for addiction recovery. CCT as a viable intervention for enhancing employment function should be further studied. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this paper was to investigate the discriminant and predictive validity of the dualistic model of passion for work. Harmonious and obsessive passion was compared to work engagement and workaholism in two studies. Study 1 was cross-sectional and supported convergent and discriminant validity of the dualistic model using exploratory structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis. Study 2 was cross-lagged and applied confirmatory factor analyses, as well as hierarchical linear modeling to test discriminant, convergent, and predictive validity of harmonious and obsessive passion for work. Predictive validity was supported for obsessive and harmonious passion with respect to wellbeing, but not with respect to performance. When controlling for work engagement and workaholism, harmonious passion was negatively related to burnout and positively related to life satisfaction. In contrast, obsessive passion related positively to burnout and negatively to life satisfaction. Only workaholism predicted variance in supervisor rated organizational citizenship behaviors (negatively related), and none of the included variables were associated with supervisor rated in-role performance.

AB  - This study explored reasons for women’s entry into sex work using data from the national bio-behavioral survey of female sex workers (FSWs) in Iran. We also compared FSWs’ reasons for those who entered sex work as a minor ( < 18) versus those as an adult ( ≥ 18). We recruited 1347 FSWs who reported having sex in exchange for money, goods, services, or drugs with at least two clients in the previous year in 13 large cities. Participants were asked about their main reason for entering into sex work. Overall, economic hardship was the main reason for entry into sex work (56.2%), followed by personal choice (20.2%), environmental forces (16.6%), and drug use (7.0%). While economic hardship was the main reason in all birth cohorts, it decreased from 68.3% among FSWs born before 1970 to 39.6% among those born in 1990 or later. Compared to women who began sex work as adults, women who entered sex work as minors were more likely to report environmental forces (31.5% vs. 15.2%, P < 0.001) and less likely to report economic hardship as reasons for beginning sex work (36.2% vs. 58.7%, P = 0.003). Our data suggest that the engagement of women in sex work in Iran is multi-factorial. The main factor is dependence on sex work for income which highlights the need for economic empowerment programs. Programs should also target environmental forces and provide access to social support services for those who have entered sex work as minors.

AB  - Emotional inertia is a central feature of emotion dynamics and it refers to the degree to which emotional states are self‐predictive and linger over time, describing their resistance to change. It is related to several indicators of maladjustment, yet there is limited research on its correlates in the workplace, where it may be particularly relevant as emotional experiences deeply influence organizational life. In two experience‐sampling studies, we studied temporal dependency of negative emotional states at work in terms of emotional inertia. In a first study (n = 128), we investigated the association between exhaustion, the core dimension of burnout, with inertia of negative emotions. In a second study (n = 116), we aimed to replicate findings from the first study and additionally examined the moderating role of inertia of negative emotions in the relationship between negative emotions at work and counterproductive work behaviour. The findings show that exhaustion is consistently associated with inertia of negative emotions, and that inertia of negative emotions aggravates the relation between negative emotions and workers' counterproductive work behaviour.

AB  - Adult children of workaholics were compared with adult children of nonworkaholics on self-concept, anxiety, depression, and locus of control. 211 Ss (aged 18–55 yrs) completed Work Addiction Risk Test (B. E. Robinson, 1989), Beck Depression Inventory, Personal Attribute Inventory, Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale, and State–Trait Anxiety Inventory. Results indicate greater depression and external locus of control among the offspring of workaholics. Children of workaholic fathers not only had greater depression and external locus of control but also scored higher on anxiety. No significant differences were found between children of workaholic mothers and children of nonworkaholic mothers on any of the variables. Self-concept was not related to parental workaholism in any of the comparisons. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Research into excessive work has gained increasing attention over the last 20 years. Terms such as 'workaholism,' 'work addiction' and 'excessive work' have been used interchangeably. Given the increase in empirical research, this study presents the development of the Bergen Work Addiction Scale (BWAS), a new psychometrically validated scale for the assessment of work addiction. A pool of 14 items, with two reflecting each of seven core elements of addiction (i.e., salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict, relapse, and problems) was initially constructed. The items were then administered to two samples, one recruited by a web survey following a television broadcast about workaholism (n = 11,769) and one comprising participants in the second wave of a longitudinal internet-based survey about working life (n = 368). The items with the highest corrected item-total correlation from within each of the seven addiction elements were retained in the final scale. The assumed one-factor solution of the refined seven-item scale was acceptable (root mean square error of approximation = 0.077, Comparative Fit Index = 0.96, Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.95) and the internal reliability of the two samples were 0.84 and 0.80, respectively. The scores of the BWAS converged with scores on other workaholism scales, except for a Work Enjoyment subscale. A suggested cut-off for categorization of workaholics showed good discriminative ability in terms of working hours, leadership position, and subjective health complaints. It is concluded that the BWAS has good psychometric properties. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: This study investigated the distinctiveness of two types of heavy work investment (i.e., workaholism and work engagement) by examining their 2-year longitudinal relationships with employee well-being and job performance. Based on a previous cross-sectional study by Shimazu and Schaufeli (Ind Health 47:495–502, 2009) and a shorter term longitudinal study by Shimazu et al. (Ind Health 50:316–21, 2012; measurement interval = 7 months), we predicted that workaholism predicts long-term future unwell-being (i.e., high ill-health and low life satisfaction) and poor job performance, whereas work engagement predicts future well-being (i.e., low ill-health and high life satisfaction) and superior job performance. Method: A two-wave survey was conducted among employees from one Japanese company, and valid data from 1,196 employees was analyzed using structural equation modeling. T1–T2 changes in ill-health, life satisfaction, and job performance were measured as residual scores, which were included in the structural equation model. Results: Workaholism and work engagement were weakly and positively related to each other. In addition, and as expected, workaholism was related to an increase in ill-health and to a decrease in life satisfaction. In contrast, and also as expected, work engagement was related to increases in both life satisfaction and job performance and to a decrease in ill-health. Conclusion: Although workaholism and work engagement are weakly positively related, they constitute two different concepts. More specifically, workaholism has negative consequences across an extended period of 2 years, whereas work engagement has positive consequences in terms of well-being and performance. Hence, workaholism should be prevented and work engagement should be stimulated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - While the academic literature acknowledges that workaholism may result from individual characteristics as well as from environmental factors, little is known about the joint impact of these two kinds of antecedents. The present study explores whether the interaction between the perception of an overwork climate in the workplace and person characteristics (i.e., achievement motivation, perfectionism, conscientiousness, self-efficacy) may foster workaholism. Data were collected on a sample of 333 Dutch employees. The results of moderated regression analyses fully supported our hypotheses and showed that the interaction between an overwork climate and person characteristics is related to workaholism. More specifically, our results revealed a significant increase in workaholism when employees both possessed person characteristics that predispose them toward workaholism and perceived an overwork climate in their workplaces. In addition, conscientiousness and self-efficacy were related to workaholism, but only in interaction with the presence of an overwork climate. These results contribute to the ongoing conceptualization of workaholism by demonstrating empirically that a work environment characterized by an overwork climate may foster workaholism, especially for those high in achievement motivation, perfectionism, conscientiousness, and self-efficacy.

AB  - We sought to explore the mediating effect of compulsory citizenship behavior in the relationship between organizational citizenship pressure and work–family conflict, and the moderating role of job autonomy in influencing the mediation. Through a 3-wave web-based survey of 312 employees in China, we found that organizational citizenship pressure was positively related to compulsory citizenship behavior, the positive impact of citizenship pressure on work–family conflict was mediated by compulsory citizenship behavior, and job autonomy mitigated the above mediation effect. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms that underpin the effect of organizational citizenship pressure on work–family conflict. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examines the mechanisms through which workaholism and work engagement impact work–home conflict and enrichment, respectively. Specifically, we examine the mediating role of positive and negative emotions (e.g. joviality and guilt) in the relationship between workaholism, work engagement and work–home outcomes. Results, based on a sample of 340 working adults participating in a two‐wave study, indicate that negative emotions—particularly anxiety, anger and disappointment—mediate the relationship between workaholism and work–home conflict and positive emotions—particularly joviality and self‐assurance—mediate the relationship between work engagement and work–home enrichment. These results provide further evidence that workaholism and work engagement are related to distinct sets of emotional variables and disparate work and home outcomes.

AB  - Background: Employment is a predictor of sobriety for women in recovery from addiction, however, finding and maintaining employment is often a challenge. A number of interventions and a large body of research exist related to improving employment outcomes of women in recovery, but most fail to account for employment as an on-going, uneven process. Objective: This study applied a longitudinal, qualitative design to explore employment experiences of women in recovery, as well as how those experiences interact with participants' sobriety, health, and well-being. Methods: Nineteen women from two residential recovery programs were interviewed four times over the course of nine months. Data were analyzed using longitudinal coding. Results: Women encounter on-going struggle to find and keep employment, and multiple forces exacerbate this struggle. At the same time, positive work experiences described by some participants illustrate opportunities for the creation of new workplace structures that address employment needs of women in recovery while supporting sobriety and overall well-being. Conclusion: Understanding employment as an on-going process that interacts with addiction and sobriety in complex and multiple ways could contribute to improved employment and health outcomes for women in recovery.

AB  - While negative attitudes within the social work community toward clients struggling with addiction may not be ubiquitous, there is evidence that such attitudes remain problematic. Interestingly, there is very little research available concerning factors that may be involved with these adverse attitudes. While extant research suggests social workers demonstrate low empathy toward clients with a Substance Use Disorder (SUD), there is little empirical exploration of the relationship between dispositional empathy and subsequent attitudes. Similarly, a practitioner’s spirituality may also influence their views of SUD clients, yet there is little evidence investigating this relationship. This study explored the relationship between empathy, spirituality, and attitudes toward clients with SUDs. Results demonstrated that both empathy and spirituality have some predictive potential and that some dimensions of empathy and spirituality interact. The results also showed that different dimensions were important for social work students and social work practitioners. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper evaluates the efficacy of treatment of 119 clients who sought help for CSBD (Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder). Using CORE OM and a tailor made supplement for CSBD, clients were evaluated at the beginning of a psycho-educational groupwork program and then again at three-month follow-up. 36 clients were evaluated a second time six-months later. The study identified, through CORE OM, that 85% of the sample were experiencing ‘clinical distress’ and 67% were at risk on intake. At three-month follow-up, there was ‘significant’ or ‘reliable’ improvement for 58% on clinical distress and 30% on risk. Compulsive sexual behaviors reduced for 97% of the sample group and 87% experienced a reduction in intrusive thoughts and feelings. However, for approximately 30% of clients, this reduction in problem symptoms was accompanied by negligible change in clinical distress and a worsening for some. A discussion is provided on why this may be and the implications of this research for treatment providers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: This study focused on workaholism as a personal attitude toward work and examined its effects on sleep quality among Japanese employees from various occupations. Purpose: The present study aimed to demonstrate the prospective association of workaholism(i.e., working excessively hard in a compulsive fashion) with sleep quality among Japanese employees. Methods: A Web-based prospective survey was conducted in October 2010 and May 2011 among registered monitors of a survey company. The questionnaire included workaholism, sleep quality, job characteristics, and demographics. Overall, 13,564 monitors were randomly invited to complete the first wave of the survey. The first 2,520 respondents were included in this study. The respondents who completed the first wave were invited to complete the second wave of the survey; 2,061 answered. A total of 364 respondents who changed their working conditions during the follow-up period were excluded. In addition, due to missing values, data from 14 respondents were excluded. Thus, the responses from 1,683 respondents were included in the analysis (859 males and 824 females). An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted to compare adjusted sleep quality at follow-up among workaholism groups (low, middle, and high). To conduct the ANCOVA, we adjusted for demographics, sleep quality at baseline, and job characteristics. Results: The high-workaholic group had significantly longer sleep latency at follow-up compared with the low- and middle-workaholic groups after adjusting for demographics, sleep latency at baseline, and job characteristics. In addition, the high-workaholic group demonstrated significantly higher levels of daytime dysfunction compared with the low-workaholic group. However, no significant differences were found among workaholic groups in terms of overall sleep quality, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, and use of sleep medication. Conclusion: Workaholism was associated with poor sleep quality at the 7-month follow-up in terms of sleep latency and daytime dysfunction.

AB  - Work offers a positive side but also it can be a framework where some risks may appear that evolve in negative outcomes. This research focus on the possible relation between two aspects of the work context: irritation at work with its two dimensions, cognitive and emotional irritation, and workaholism. So far the two concepts have been studied in their relation to other variables, but there is a lack of studies on the relation between them. To carry out this investigation 285 subjects from different occupations answered the instruments used and we found results in the expected way. Irritation, both cognitive and emotional irritation, showed significant correlations with both factors of the DUWAS However, in the case of the WBAT the correlations were significant only for factor 1, working excessively. Regression analysis yielded interesting results in order to explain the relation between both concepts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A dearth of counseling literature examines the experiences of people of color, including African American women and men, in relation to work–life balance. The authors, therefore, investigated the association between life-balance domains and work addiction for African Americans. A multiple regression analysis of 115 African American participants (47 men, 68 women) indicated a significant relationship between life-balance domains and work addiction. In particular, community support was an important indicator of decreased work addiction. Career counselors and mental health counselors need to develop an understanding of how extended familial and social networks assist African American clients in effectively managing work–life balance.

AB  - Background: Burnout, work engagement and work addiction are all considered components of psychological health in the workplace. Past research indicates that healthcare providers face significant challenges to their psychological wellbeing in the workplace. Objective: This study sought to determine the extent of these components in a sample of Canadian occupational therapists. Methods: An anonymous electronic survey including standardized measures of burnout, work engagement and work addiction. Results: Participants' scores at times differed from previous research on burnout in the occupational therapy profession in that they demonstrated higher depersonalization scores and lower emotional exhaustion scores. Relationships emerged among a number of elements within the various measures, and participants' age and years of experience. Scores indicating a risk of burnout and work addiction clustered at certain times across participants' years of experience, and scores for vigour were low in comparison to an international study of healthcare workers. However, scores in other elements were high (for example, dedication and personal accomplishment), which theorists propose may serve a protective role in mitigating high scores in negative elements. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate a risk for diminished work-related psychological health and point to key areas for further investigation around which targeted interventions could be organized for members of the occupational therapy profession.

AB  - The aims of this two-year follow-up study among Finnish managers (n = 463) were twofold: first, to investigate the relation between work engagement and workaholism by utilizing both variable- and person-centered approaches and second, to explore whether and how experiences of work engagement and workaholism relate to job change during the study period. The variable-centered analysis based on Structural Equadon Modelling revealed that the latent factors of work engagement and workaholism did not correlate with each other, thereby suggesting that they are independent constructs. The personcentered inspection with Growth Mixture Modelling indicated four work engagement-workaholism classes: 1) 'high decreasing WE - low stable WH' (18%), 2) 'low increasing WE - average decreasing WH' (7%), 3) 'low decreasing WE - low stable WH' (6%), and 4) 'high stable WE - average stable WH' (68%). Overall, these results suggest first that also at the intra-individual level work engagement and workaholism were largely independent psychological states (changes in work engagement and workaholism were related only in the class 'low increasing WE - average decreasing WH', 7%); second, job conditions had an impact on the levels of both work engagement and workaholism as, typically, the participants in the class 'low increasing WE - average decreasing WH' had typically changed their job during the study period. The fact that work engagement and workaholism are sensitive to job changes suggests that both psychological conditions depend - at least partly - on the individual's work situation.

AB  - Objectives: Although it is understood that work-related factors, including job demands, job control, and workplace support, are associated with workers’ health and well-being, the role played by personal characteristics, especially workaholism, has not been fully investigated. This study examined workaholism’s associations with psychological ill health, low back pain with disability, and sickness absence among Japanese workers. Methods: A cross-sectional Internet survey was conducted using self-administered questionnaires. Data from 3,899 Japanese workers were analyzed. Workaholism was measured using the Dutch Workaholism Scale (DUWAS). Scores were divided into tertiles, where respondents were classified into three groups (high, middle, and low). Depressive mood as a measure of psychological ill health was assessed using the SF-36 mental health subscale, and low back pain using a standardized question. Sickness absence, except that due to physical injuries, was categorized either as absence due to mental health problems or to physical/somatic problems including the common cold. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the association between workaholism and depressive mood, low back pain with disability, and sickness absence, adjusting for demographic characteristics, job demand, job control, and workplace support. Results: Compared to the low workaholism group, the middle and high workaholism groups had significantly higher odds for depressive mood (Odds ratio (OR) = 1.93 and 3.62 for the middle and high groups, respectively), disabling back pain (ORs = 1.36 and 1.77 for the middle and high groups, respectively). Workaholism was more strongly associated with sickness absence due to mental health problems than that for other reasons (ORs = 1.76 vs. 1.21 for the middle group and 3.52 vs. 1.37 for the high groups). Conclusions: Workaholism is significantly associated with poor psychological health, disabling back pain, and sickness absence, particularly from mental health problems. Therefore, workaholism must be considered when addressing wellbeing of workers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this paper was to investigate the associations between attachment styles, perfectionism, and job motivational potential with job engagement and workaholism. A self-report questionnaire that included psychometrically-sound measures of the key constructs was completed by a sample of 139 employees. Correlation analyses, a hierarchical regression, and a structural equation model were conducted to test the proposed relations and mediating hypotheses. Adaptive perfectionism was found to be related to job engagement, whereas maladaptive perfectionism emerged associated to both safe- and non-safe attachment styles. Moreover, only one attachment style (non-safe) and one type of perfectionism (maladaptive) were found to be linked to workaholism. Managers should pay attention to employees characterized by a non-safe attachment style and perfectionist personalities. Efforts should be made to improve job engagement among employees and to enhance constructive workaholism. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Rationale: Brain catecholamines have long been implicated in reinforcement learning, exemplified by catecholamine drug and genetic effects on probabilistic reversal learning. However, the mechanisms underlying such effects are unclear. Objectives and methods: Here we investigated effects of an acute catecholamine challenge with methylphenidate (20 mg, oral) on a novel probabilistic reversal learning paradigm in a within-subject, double-blind randomised design. The paradigm was designed to disentangle effects on punishment avoidance from effects on reward perseveration. Given the known large individual variability in methylphenidate’s effects, we stratified our effects by working memory capacity and trait impulsivity, putatively modulating the effects of methylphenidate, in a large sample (n = 102) of healthy volunteers. Results: Contrary to our prediction, methylphenidate did not alter performance in the reversal phase of the task. Our key finding is that methylphenidate altered learning of choice-outcome contingencies in a manner that depended on individual variability in working memory span. Specifically, methylphenidate improved performance by adaptively reducing the effective learning rate in participants with higher working memory capacity. Conclusions: This finding emphasises the important role of working memory in reinforcement learning, as reported in influential recent computational modelling and behavioural work, and highlights the dependence of this interplay on catecholaminergic function.

AB  - Human trafficking has received considerable attention from policymakers, researchers and service providers globally, with resulting interventions often positioning trafficking as something that simply exists. Drawing on Bacchi’s ‘What’s the Problem Represented to be?’ approach, this article proposes that trafficking is continually made through efforts designed to eradicate it. We conducted 22 interviews with representatives from social service organisations funded by the government of Ontario, Canada, for anti-trafficking programming. These interviews provide insight into how trafficking is being represented and with what effects. Our findings suggest that organisational initiatives often rely on individualised health-related interventions, such as trauma-informed counselling and other mental health support, to address trafficking. In the process, various sex work activities are deemed ‘symptoms’ of trafficking, and perceived pathways to engaging in sex work (such as drug use/dependence, a history of trauma and low self-esteem) are produced as ‘causes’ or ‘risk factors’. We contend that by pathologising sex work and sex workers, organisations are employing a contradictory neoliberal paternalism to advance a public health representation of human trafficking that simultaneously responsibilises and disenfranchises purported victims.

AB  - While several quantitative studies exist describing the factors associated with maintaining objectives attained by people with addictions during their stay in residential therapeutic centres (RTC), few studies have examined the point of view of the residents themselves on this question. In the present study, qualitative interviews were conducted with 45 residents of an RTC in the Paris area at the end of their stay or in the 4–9 following months. Residents’ views confirmed the importance of: consolidating risk and stress management skills during their stay; adopting a holistic well-being approach; developing a truly personal health project; a treatment centre that really seems to care; peer support during and after their stay; and improving family and social networks. Obstacles included residents with rarer addictions feeling left out during group work; insufficient anticipation of the risks associated with returning to everyday life; a supportive group approach that disappears when returning to everyday life; and too great a gap between the RTC approach and the values of both the individual’s personal social network and their follow-up care professionals. In conclusion, although residents underline the therapeutic success of their stay, key questions remain concerning obstacles in recovery pathways when returning into real life situations.

AB  - The aim of this study was to establish a typology of employee well‐being, together with its psychosocial antecedents and consequences. Results obtained with a sample of 786 full‐time employees from different occupational sectors show four types of employee well‐being: 9‐to‐5 or relaxed, work engaged or enthusiastic, workaholic or tense, and burned‐out or fatigued, each having different relationships with job and personal characteristics. This study provides evidence of a parsimonious, theory‐based classification of employee well‐being and contributes to the existing literature about work investment because meaningful relations were found between various types of employee well‐being, and heavy and soft work investors.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive models of workaholism do not allow diagnosing it as an addiction. We introduce an empirical evidence for conceptualization and measurement of work addiction as work craving. The Work Craving Scale (WCS) comprises: (a) obsessive-compulsive desire for work, (b) anticipation of self-worth compensation, (c) anticipation of reduction of negative affect or withdrawal symptoms resulting from working, and (d) neurotic perfectionism. Results (N = 1,459) confirmed the four-factorial structure of the WCS and indicated its good validity and reliability. The conceptualization of work craving significantly contributes to understanding of workaholism as an addiction, and should stimulate future research on work craving.

AB  - Psychologists in medication for addiction treatment (MAT) settings routinely oversee the work of addiction counselors as supervisors, administrators, and human resource specialists. Limited research has explored the lived experiences of counselors who work in programs that have scaled-up MAT in response to the opioid crisis in the U.S. Thirty-one addiction counselors who worked in MAT programs that had scaled-up treatment capacity were interviewed about 3 facets of their lived experiences: work roles, work motivation, and perceived responses of others to their work. Interviews were taped and transcribed. An interdisciplinary team reviewed and coded the transcripts using grounded theory analysis. The main work roles that emerged were counselor, educator, and advocate. Counselors described multiple factors related to intrinsic motivation for their work: family and personal history, altruism, enjoyment of challenges and client complexity, and witnessing and facilitating change. Factors related to extrinsic motivation were workplace opportunities and positive feedback. The main themes concerning responses of nonclients were positive feedback; others’ narratives; negative feedback focused on the stigma associated with the treatment, the clients who receive it, and the counselors who provide it; and responses to anticipated negative feedback. Responses from clients were largely positive and focused on appreciation and respect. Psychologists in MAT settings can enhance the lived experiences of addiction counselors by helping them to savor positive feedback from clients and others, to recognize and appreciate their unique skillsets, and to recognize and address (not internalize) the multiple sources of stigma they encounter as addiction counselors.

AB  - Impact Statement—Addiction counselors have multiple work roles, including counselor, educator, and advocate. Counselors’ work motivation may be enhanced by offering onsite learning opportunities. Policy makers should both be aware of the stigma faced by addiction counselors and consider providing funding to develop strategies to mitigate it.

AB  - The present research proposes an improved understanding of work motivation by identifying employees’ motivational profiles while taking into account the dual global and specific nature of work motivation proposed by self‐determination theory (SDT). To document the construct validity of these latent profiles, we relied on the circumplex model of employees’ well‐being to investigate whether they differed in terms of burnout, work satisfaction, and work addiction. Results from analyses conducted among a sample of 955 employees revealed five distinct profiles characterized by differing levels of global and specific forms of motivation: Intrinsically Motivated, Poorly Motivated, Driven, Conflicted, and Self‐Determined. Lower levels of burnout and work satisfaction were associated with profiles characterized by higher global levels of self‐determination and more autonomous forms of motivation, matching theoretical expectations. Interestingly, work addiction was highest in the Driven profile and lowest in the Self‐Determined profile, suggesting that autonomous forms of motivation are not always able to buffer the adverse effects of controlled forms of motivation. Our results also suggest that the specific qualities of work motivations are just as important as the global levels of self‐determination in the identification of work motivation profiles.

AB  - Workaholism and work engagement both indicate high involvement with work, leading to some conceptual confusion. There are important differences, however, but few researchers have investigated the distinction. In this study, I used the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model (Demerouti, Bakker, Nachreiner, & Schaufeli, 2001) to propose an integrative model to demonstrate their meoretical and empirical dissimilarity. I chose turnover intention (TT) and occupational citizenship behavior (OCB) to measure organizational outcomes. The results showed that job resources were positively related to work engagement and that job demands moderated die relationship between job resources and work engagement. In addition, job demands were positively related to workaholism and job resources moderated the relationship between job demands and workaholism. Finally, work engagement influenced TI negatively and OCB positively. However, although workaholism influenced OCB negatively, as expected, die negative influence of workaholism on TI was contrary to my hypothesis.

AB  - We evaluated the relationship between workaholism and 2 individual difference variables relevant to an organizational context, namely: proactive personality and locomotion orientation. Specifically, we examined working excessively (WE), working compulsively (WC), and perceived self-efficacy, proactivity, and locomotion in a sample of nurses working in an Italian public hospital. Data were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Because WE and WC were not distinct factors, a unitary workaholism factor was used when applying regression analysis. As expected, workaholism was related negatively to proactivity, and positively to locomotion. In contrast, its relationship with self-efficacy was nonsignificant. The practical implications of our findings and future research directions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Menthol is an organic compound derived from the plant genus Mentha and is the most commonly added tastant to tobacco products. Users of mentholated tobacco products typically have greater dependence as well as poorer cessation outcomes. These effects are thought to be partially driven by menthol’s pleasing taste as well as menthol’s masking of aversive tastants in tobacco products, thereby increasing their palatability. However, there are two predominant stereoisomers contained in mentholated products in varying proportions: (−)-menthol and (+)-menthol. The palatability of these stereoisomers has not been directly tested. The objective of this study was to measure whether there are differences in oral taste preference among (−)-menthol and (+)-menthol. Method: Using a two-bottle choice assay, we measured taste preference over a range of (−)-menthol and (+)-menthol doses (10 mg/L, 50 mg/L, and 100 mg/L) in Sprague–Dawley adolescent (postnatal day 33–41) male and female rats. Results: Results showed a dose-dependent aversion to menthol at 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L (p < .0001), but not at 10 mg/L. These effects were not dependent on stereoisomer or sex. Conclusion: These findings suggest that (−)-menthol and (+)-menthol are equally potent in producing oral taste aversion. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)
AB  - Public Significance Statement—Menthol is a commonly added tastant that masks bitter, unpleasant flavors in tobacco products which can increase drug dependence. This work shows that different stereoisomers of menthol, (−)-menthol and (+)-menthol, produce similar behavioral oral taste aversion responses in rats. This work suggests that both stereoisomers may play a role in masking unpleasant flavors, and therefore either may exacerbate tobacco dependence.

AB  - Background: Greater cognitive performance has been shown to be associated with better mental and physical health and lower mortality. The present study contributes to the existing literature on the linkages of self-perceived income sufficiency and cognitive impairment. Study also provides additional insights on other socioeconomic and health-related variables that are associated with cognitive impairment in older ages. Methods: Data for this study is derived from the 'Building Knowledge Base on Population Ageing in India'. The final sample size for the analysis after removing missing cases was 9176 older adults. Descriptive along with bivariate analyses were presented to show the plausible associations of cognitive impairment with potential risk factors using the chi-square test. Also, binary logistic regression analysis was performed to provide the relationship between cognitive impairment and risk factors. The software used was STATA 14. Results: About 43% of older adults reported that they had no source of income and 7.2% had income but not sufficient to fulfil their basic needs. Older adults with income but partially sufficient to fulfil their basic needs had 39% significantly higher likelihood to suffer from cognitive impairment than older adults who had sufficient income [OR: 1.39; OR: 1.21–1.59]. Likelihood of cognitive impairment was low among older adults with asset ownership than older adults with no asset ownership [OR: 0.83; CI: 0.72–0.95]. Again, older adults who work by compulsion (73.3%) or felt mental or physical stress due to work (57.6%) had highest percentage of cognitive impairment. Moreover, older adults with poor self-rated health, low instrumental activities of daily living, low activities of daily living, low subjective well-being and low psychological health were at increased risk for cognitive impairment. Conclusion: The study highlights the pressing need for care and support and especially financial incentives in the old age to preserve cognitive health. Further, while planning geriatric health care for older adults in India, priority must be given to financially backward, with no asset ownership, with poor health status, older-older, widowed, and illiterate older individuals, as they are more vulnerable to cognitive impairment.

AB  - Employee organizational identification has been proposed and found to be positively related to employee health and well-being. The empirical evidence, however, is not unequivocal, and some authors have suggested possible downsides of identification with the organization as a whole or with a group within it. The potential negative effect of over-identification was tested empirically for the first time in the present paper. Two studies were conducted; Study 1 was cross-sectional and used a sample of Italian law court clerks (N = 195) and Study 2 was longitudinal and employed a sample of Italian teachers (N = 140 at T2). We proposed a curvilinear mediation model with identification curvilinearly predicting workaholism, and workaholism, in turn, negatively affecting employee well-being. This curvilinear link between organizational identification and workaholism means that workaholism at first decreases with growing identification, but when identification becomes too strong, workaholism increases. The results confirmed our hypotheses, and we discuss theoretical and practical implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The authors examined the various antecedents and consequences of workaholism using a sample of 336 undergraduate students in the United States. Path analysis revealed that perfectionism and negative affect significantly predicted workaholism scores. Further, the effect of workaholism on life satisfaction was significantly mediated by leisure boredom and loneliness. Another path suggested that perfectionism directly predicted loneliness, with greater loneliness being significantly related to lower life satisfaction. The authors discuss the implications for organizational interventions and suggest recommendations for future research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Previous research has distinguished between two types of working hard: workaholism, a 'bad' type of working hard, and work engagement, a 'good' type of working hard. However, the motivations underlying workaholism and work engagement have not been examined extensively. Building on Deci and Ryan’s Self-Determination Theory, the present study examined the motivational correlates of workaholism, work engagement, and burnout (a possible consequence of working hard), using data from Chinese health care professionals (544 nurses and 216 physicians), and controlling for job demands and resources. As expected, structural equation modeling revealed that high levels of workaholism were associated with high levels of introjected regulation and identified regulation; that high levels of work engagement were mainly associated with high levels of intrinsic regulation; and that high levels of burnout were mainly associated with low levels of intrinsic regulation. Thus, different types of motivational regulation are associated with different types of job-related well-being. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Although workaholics and work engaged employees both work long hours, they seem to have a different underlying motivation to do so. The mood as input model might offer an explanation for the difference in work persistence of these employees. This model suggests that the interplay of mood and 'persistence rules' (enough and enjoyment rules) may lead to different kinds of persistence mechanisms. Purpose: The aims of this study are to present a scale for measuring persistence rules, the Work Persistence rules Checklist (WoPeC), to analyze its psychometric properties and to test the mood as input model in relationship with workaholism and work engagement. Method: Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Results: Results of a confirmatory factor analysis in study 1 provided support for the hypothesized factor structure of the WoPeC. In study 2, it appeared that the use of an enough and an enjoyment rule for determining when to continue working is related to workaholism and work engagement, respectively. Furthermore, it was hypothesized and found that negative mood is related to workaholism, whereas positive mood is associated with work engagement. The expected interactions between mood and persistence rules on workaholism and work engagement were not demonstrated. Conclusion: Mood and persistence rules seem relevant for explaining the difference between workaholism and work engagement. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Building on Deci and Ryan's Self-Determination Theory and Meijman and Mulder's Effort-Recovery Model, the present study examined the nature, antecedents, and consequences of working hard (i.e., workaholism and work engagement) in a Dutch convenience sample of 1,246 employees. A confirmatory factor analysis showed that workaholism and work engagement were two largely independent concepts. Crossing these two concepts yielded four types of workers: workaholic employees, engaged employees, engaged workaholics, and nonworkaholic/nonengaged employees. MANOVA and subsequent ANOVAs were used to compare these four groups regarding their motivation, working hours, and levels of burnout. As expected, study results revealed that workaholic employees were driven by controlled motivation, whereas engaged employees were driven by autonomous motivation. Engaged workaholics were driven by both controlled and autonomous motivation. In addition, the results revealed that engaged workaholics spent most time on working. Unlike workaholic employees, engaged workaholics did not experience the highest levels of burnout, suggesting that high engagement may buffer the adverse consequences of workaholism. The present study emphasizes the importance of differentiating among at least three categories of employees who work hard: workaholic employees, engaged employees, and—for the first time—engaged workaholics.

AB  - In this study, we further explored whether any of the dimensions in the five-factor model of personality (i.e., openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) were related to facets of workaholism (i.e., work involvement, work drive, and work enjoyment) in a sample of American workers in various occupational settings. Results showed that personality factors explained a significant amount of the variance for each workaholism facet, above and beyond personal demographics. Conscientiousness and agreeableness were positively related to work involvement, while conscientiousness and openness to experience were positively related to work drive. Agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience were positively related to work enjoyment, while neuroticism was negatively related to work enjoyment. By identifying personality factors related to workaholism, employers can better predict workaholic tendencies during recruitment and selection.

AB  - Background: A lack of conceptual modeling of how the components of opioid maintenance treatment (OMT) for opioid dependence (OD) work causes it to occasionally be labeled the 'black-box' of treatment. This study had a two-fold objective: First, to analyze which factors related to OMT for OD contribute to the abstinence of problematic use of non-prescribed opioids and sustain recovery, from the patients’ perspective; second, to understand which changes OMT produced in the individuals’ lives might significantly contribute to relapse prevention. Methods: We used qualitative methods of design, inquiry, and analysis from a convenience sample of 19 individuals in a Swedish treatment setting. Results: All the participants reported previous cycles of problematic use of non-prescribed opioids and other non-prescribed psychoactive substances, treatment, abstinence, recovery, and relapse before starting the current OMT program. During the pre-treatment stage, specific events, internal processes, and social environments enhanced motivation toward abstinence and seeking treatment. During the treatment stage, participants perceived the quality of the human relationships established with primary social groups as important as medication and the individual plan of care in sustaining recovery. From the participants’ perspective, OMT was a turning point in their life course, allowing them a sense of self-fulfillment and the reconstruction of personal and social identity. However, they still struggled with the stigmatization produced by a society that values abstinence-oriented over medication-assisted treatments. Conclusion: OMT is not an isolated event in individuals’ lives but rather a process occurring within a specific social context. Structural factors and the sense of acceptance and belonging are essential in supporting the transformation. Treatment achievements and the risk for relapse vary over time, so the objectives of the treatment plan must account for characteristics of the pre-treatment stage and the availability and capacity of individuals to restructure their social network, besides the opioid maintenance treatment and institutional social care.

AB  - Background The underlying mechanisms connecting workaholism on the one hand and ill-health and performance on the other hand have to date hardly been examined empirically. Purpose The aim was to study the mediating role of coping (i.e., active coping and emotional discharge) in the relationship between workaholism, ill-health (i.e., psychological distress and physical complaints), and job performance. Method A theory-based model was tested among 757 employees of a Japanese construction machinery company. Results Workaholism was positively related to active coping, which was, in its turn, negatively associated with ill-health and positively with job performance. Workaholism was also positively related to emotional discharge, which was positively associated with ill-health. In addition, workaholism was positively and directly related to ill-health, whereas it was not significantly related to job performance. Conclusion Workaholism is associated with both active coping and emotional discharge. Active coping leads to better health and performance, whereas emotional discharge leads to poor health. In addition, workaholism coincides with poor health. Since the costs for workaholics themselves (in terms of ill-health) are high, workaholism has on average adverse effects on health and performance.

AB  - In recent years, workaholism has become prevalent throughout organizations and has captured the attention of organizational leaders as well as the academic and scientific communities. Most research in this area has focused on the negative consequences of workaholism, specifically work-life imbalance. One area of research that has largely been ignored is the potential influence of demographic variables on the relationship between workaholism and work-life imbalance. Therefore, the current study focused on how cultural origin might influence the intensity of this relationship. Based on relative deprivation theory and previous empirical work, it was expected that cultural origin would moderate the relationship between workaholism and work-life imbalance. Specifically, it was predicted that Caucasian participants would score higher on levels of workaholism than Black participants, and that the relationship between workaholism and work-life imbalance would be stronger for Caucasians than for Blacks. The results revealed that high levels of workaholism were significantly correlated with high levels of work-life imbalance. However, results also indicated that cultural origin did not moderate the relationship between workaholism and work-life imbalance, and there was no significant mean difference between Caucasian and Black participants on our measure of workaholism. These findings are important in that it is essential for employers to be aware of workaholic tendencies so they can better handle the negative consequences that result for the organization, and to also help promote the well-being of their employees.

AB  - Sex work is perceived as an undesirable activity in India. It is widely believed that sex workers are either the victims of trafficking or have taken up sex work out of compulsion. Furthermore, it is often assumed that people who pursue sex work live in brothels or solicit customers outside their homes. Drawing on findings from an ethnographic study of the Kanjar community of northern India, this paper argues to the contrary. Veering away from accounts of individual women as victims, this paper focuses on dhandha (sex work) as a ‘legitimate’ community practice. For the Kanjars, sex work is a traditional occupation with a long complex history and a distinct subculture embedded in its economic structure. For those involved, the family economy is based on the labour and earnings of unmarried women who earn income as dhandhewalis (sex workers). Sex work may not be an option that Kanjars choose, but it is certainly a practice that they are neither ashamed of, nor apologetic about. Their positive, if not defiant, attitude can be understood in the context of the specific subculture of the Kanjars. The term ‘subculture’ as used here being specific to the community and its traditions, as distinct from dominant mainstream Indian culture.

AB  - Workaholism is defined as an irresistible inner drive to work excessively. Accordingly, it is assessed with a questionnaire that measures working excessively (WE) and working compulsively (WC), representing the behavioral and cognitive aspects of workaholism, respectively. A cluster-analysis using a nationwide sample of Dutch medical residents (N = 2,115) resulted in 4 groups: (a) workaholics, (b) nonworkaholics, (c) hardworking residents, and (d) compulsive working residents. As predicted, the combination of WE and WC was related to the most unfavorable conditions in terms of resident’s job demands (i.e., work overload, work–home conflict, overwork, role conflict, mental demands, emotional demands, and organizational demands), job resources (i.e., social support from colleagues, participation in decision making, feedback, supervisory coaching, and opportunities to learn), well-being (i.e., burnout, happiness, recovery), and organizational behavior (i.e., 'presenteeism,' and medical performance). Taken together, our results confirm the suitability of conceptualizing workaholism as an inner drive to work excessively hard. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study, conducted on a nation-wide sample of Dutch junior doctors (also called medical residents) (N = 2115), investigated the unique relationships of workaholism with burnout and well-being, and hypothesized that (inter- and intra-) role conflict would mediate these effects. The results of multi-group structural equation modelling analyses offered support for this model. Specifically, role conflict fully mediated the relationships between workaholism (i.e. working excessively and working compulsively) and job demands (i.e. emotional, mental and organizational demands) on the one hand, and burnout (i.e. emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and reduced medical accomplishment) and well-being (job satisfaction, happiness and perceived health) on the other hand. This indicates that workaholism contributed incrementally to explaining positive (well-being) and negative (burnout) outcomes beyond common indicators of job demands.

AB  - This study examined the relationships between workaholism, perceived parental workaholism, self-acceptance, psychological well-being, and physical symptoms among 347 college students. Statistically significant relationships were found between college students' perceived parental workaholism and their own workaholism. Also, relationships between workaholism, self-acceptance, psychological well-being, and physical symptoms were discovered. Students with higher perceptions of parental workaholism reported lower levels of psychological well-being, lower levels of self acceptance, and more physical health complaints. Implications and limitations are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study of 168 dual-earner couples examined the relationship between workaholism and relationship satisfaction. More specifically, on the basis of the literature, it was hypothesized that workaholism is positively related to work-family conflict. In addition, the authors predicted that workaholism is related to reduced support provided to the partner, through work-family conflict, and that individuals who receive considerable support from their partners are more satisfied with their relationship. Finally, the authors hypothesized direct crossover of relationship satisfaction between partners. The results of structural equation modeling analyses using the matched responses of both partners supported these hypotheses. Moreover, in line with predictions, the authors found that gender did not affect the strength of the relationships in the proposed model. The authors discuss workplace interventions as possible ways to help workaholics and their partners. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A sample group of 19 recovering sex and porn addicts who had attended both one-to-one and group therapy at the Laurel Centre sex addiction clinic in the UK undertook an hour-long semi-structured interview relating to the usefulness of group work to their recovery. Interview data was analysed for themes and cross-referenced with Yalom’s 11 therapeutic factors of group therapy (Yalom and Leszcz, 2005). Some additional themes were also found that related specifically to the Hall Recovery Course psycho-educational programme that they each attended. Group work was found to be more important to participants’ recovery than one-to-one therapy but this was not consistent, and drawbacks to group work were also identified.

AB  - This study examined the associations between workaholism and perceived health (exhaustion, physical complaints, and feelings of professional efficacy) in a sample of 477 Dutch self-employed workers. We defined workaholism as having two components: (1) spending many hours on one's work, and (2) the inability to detach from work. We expected that both workaholism components would be related to ill health. ANOVA and regression analyses revealed that this reasoning was confirmed for one component (inability to detach from work), whereas the other component (working long hours) was unrelated to the outcome variables. In order to increase understanding of these findings, we suggest that more theoretical work be conducted on the mechanisms linking workaholism to its presumed antecedents and consequences.

AB  - The present study investigated in a sample of 587 telecom managers whether workaholism, burnout, and work engagement--the supposed antipode of burnout--can be distinguished empirically. These three concepts were measured with existing, validated multi-dimensional questionnaires. Structural equation modeling revealed that a slightly modified version of the hypothesised model that assumed three distinct yet correlated constructs--burnout, engagement, and workaholism--fitted the data best. Multiple regression analyses revealed that these three concepts retained unique hypothesised patterns of relationships with variables from five clusters representing (1) long working hours, (2) job characteristics, (3) work outcomes, (4) quality of social relationships, and (5) perceived health, respectively. In sum, our analyses provided converging evidence that workaholism, burnout, and engagement are three different kinds of employee well-being rather than three of a kind.

AB  - Adopting an operational definition of workaholism as discretionary investment of considerable time at work, the purpose of the present study was to test hypotheses regarding the cognitive aspect of workaholism, as well as the positive and negative/addictive views of this construct. The study employed an experience-sampling method (ESM), using a sample of 65 full-time employees who completed the ESM forms at four random times during the day for one week. Results indicated that workaholism was associated with continued cognitive engagement with work, accompanied by a preference for work over leisure activity and higher positive affect during work activity than during leisure activity. No significant differences were found between workaholics and non-workaholics with regard to the likelihood of performing work-related activities during leisure activity, or in the levels of physical discomfort and negative affect during the weekend. These results highlight the utility of an operational framework for studying the variety of workaholism correlates. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed.

AB  - Although workaholism has been hypothesized to have an effect on interpersonal relationships, few studies have obtained data from other individuals in a focal person's network. The present exploratory study examined level of agreement in both workaholism components proposed by Spence and Robbins (see record [rid]1992-18384-001[/rid]; work involvement, feeling driven to work, work enjoyment) and hours worked per week between 62 women and men in professional and managerial jobs and a self-nominated coworker. Data were collected using anonymously completed questionnaires. There was considerable agreement between the two individuals on levels of the three workaholism components and hours worked per week.

AB  - The aims of the present study were to examine (1) psychometric properties of Spence and Robbins' measures of the components of workaholism and (2) relations between workaholism and health-related outcomes [job stress, burnout, work engagement, and subjective health complaints (SHC)]. Two hundred and thirty-five bank employees completed questionnaires measuring workaholism, job stress, burnout, work engagement, and SHC. Factor analyses suggested a two-factor model of workaholism, 'Drive' and 'Enjoyment of Work'. There were significant relations between workaholism subscales and SHC, job stress, burnout, and work engagement. The 'Drive' subscale correlated positively with job stress and SHC, and marginally with burnout and work engagement. The 'Enjoyment of Work' subscale correlated negatively with job stress, burnout, and SHC. The results showed that a two-factor model of workaholism provided the best fit for Norwegian data, supported a differentiation of enthusiastic and nonenthusiastic workaholic features, and were related in predictable ways to SHC, burnout, and work engagement, as predicted from contemporary cognitive stress theory.

AB  - We investigated the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Dutch Work Addiction Scale (DUWAS) by using an Italian sample (N = 1,027) and a comparable Dutch sample (N = 7,523). We first conducted multigroup confirmatory factor analysis and reliability analysis. We then examined the correlations of the DUWAS with job demands, work-family conflict, job-related affective well-being, and psychological and physical strain. Results showed that a two-factor solution of the DUWAS was equivalent across the Italian and Dutch samples, with data supporting factor variance and covariance equivalence in addition to metric equivalence. Internal consistencies of the DUWAS and its subscales were adequate, and test-retest reliability showed a strong stability of the measure at one year. The DUWAS and its subscales showed a pattern of correlations in the expected direction with the adopted criterion measures. Overall, the Italian version of the DUWAS shows adequate validity and reliability. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We examined scores on the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI; Raskin & Terry, 1988) in relation to drive to work, enjoyment of and engagement in work, and professional position. A sample of 235 Norwegian bank employees completed a cross-sectional survey. We found that managers scored higher than subordinates on all measures. NPI scores correlated significantly and positively with drive, enjoyment of and engagement in work. Multiple regression analyses controlling for demographic and work variables showed that narcissism was significantly related to enjoyment of work and work engagement but unrelated to drive. Although the associations were rather weak, our findings support previous clinical observations of narcissistic traits in workaholics as well as findings in empirical research on narcissistic traits in managers.

AB  - The leader role carries several complexities, suggesting that identifying closely with one’s role as a leader might be both beneficial and costly on a day-to-day basis. We integrate theories of leader identity, self-sacrificial leadership, and self-regulation to develop a conceptual model articulating the manner in which strongly identifying with one’s leader role on a daily basis yields benefits (i.e., increased task performance and perceived prosocial impact) and costs (i.e., increased depletion and conflict at home) via increased self-sacrificial leader behavior. Further, we theorize and test whether work addiction moderates the indirect effects of leader identity on the aforementioned processes. Using an experience sampling investigation of 80 leaders who completed 3 surveys per day for 10 workdays (Level 1 n = 645), we found that daily leader identity was positively associated with self-sacrificial leader behavior which, in turn, was positively associated with task performance and perceived prosocial impact (leader benefits) and positively associated with resource depletion and conflict at home (leader costs). Moreover, these effects were stronger for leaders who reported higher (vs. lower) levels of work addiction. In an exploration considering the effects of leader identity on daily well-being, results indicated that leader identity also indirectly helped and hindered psychological detachment from work.

AB  - Given the significant social and economic costs and/or benefits associated with workplace deviance, researchers have been interested in examining the antecedents of deviant behaviour. Similarly, as the incidence of workaholism has increased, there has been a need to further understand the positive and negative consequences of workaholism in an organizational context. This exploratory study examined the relationship of three workaholism components with measures of workplace destructive and constructive deviance. Data were collected from 142 male and female employees working in six companies in Brazil using anonymously completed questionnaires. The results suggest that the workaholism components were significantly related to two measures of deviance. This provides partial support for the hypothesized relationship. Future research directions and practical implications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Workaholism has been conceptualized as a syndrome although there have been few tests that explicitly consider its syndrome status. The authors analyzed a three-dimensional scale of workaholism developed by Spence and Robbins (1992) using cluster analysis. The authors identified three clusters of individuals, one of which corresponded to Spence and Robbins's profile of the workaholic (high work involvement, high drive to work, low work enjoyment). Consistent with previously conjectured relations with workaholism, individuals in the workaholic cluster were more likely to label themselves as workaholics, more likely to have acquaintances label them as workaholics, and more likely to have lower life satisfaction and higher work-life imbalance. The importance of considering workaholism as a syndrome and the implications for effective interventions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Attention‐deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has consistently been associated with substance use, but the nature of this association is not fully understood. To inform intervention development and public health messages, a vital question is whether there are causal pathways from ADHD to substance use and/or vice versa. We applied bidirectional Mendelian randomization, using summary‐level data from the largest available genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) on ADHD, smoking (initiation, cigarettes per day, cessation, and a compound measure of lifetime smoking), alcohol use (drinks per week, alcohol problems, and alcohol dependence), cannabis use (initiation), and coffee consumption (cups per day). Genetic variants robustly associated with the 'exposure' were selected as instruments and identified in the 'outcome' GWAS. Effect estimates from individual genetic variants were combined with inverse‐variance weighted regression and five sensitivity analyses (weighted median, weighted mode, MR‐Egger, generalized summary data–based MR, and Steiger filtering). We found evidence that liability to ADHD increases likelihood of smoking initiation and heaviness of smoking among smokers, decreases likelihood of smoking cessation, and increases likelihood of cannabis initiation. There was weak evidence that liability to ADHD increases alcohol dependence risk but not drinks per week or alcohol problems. In the other direction, there was weak evidence that smoking initiation increases ADHD risk, but follow‐up analyses suggested a high probability of horizontal pleiotropy. There was no clear evidence of causal pathways between ADHD and coffee consumption. Our findings corroborate epidemiological evidence, suggesting causal pathways from liability to ADHD to smoking, cannabis use, and, tentatively, alcohol dependence. Further work is needed to explore the exact mechanisms mediating these causal effects. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to investigate the components of Type-A personality, that are related to stress, with a group of Turkish male personnel (N = 454), working in the area of public security. The assessment instruments were; Institutional Stress Factors Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory, Type-A Personality Scale, Multidimensional Anger Scale, and Ways of Coping Scale. The results showed that, Type-A's and Type-B's differed among themselves according to their anger scores. The most significant difference in terms of the perceived stress factors and stress symptoms was found to be between Type-A's high in anger and Type-B's low in anger. Type-A's high in anger, had significantly higher perceived stress scores and reported to use significantly more ineffective coping styles (helpless and submissive approaches), compared the other groups. The regression analyses showed that the component of Type-A behavior that is predictive of perceived stress is obsession with work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Two dimensions of workaholism - Drive to work and Enjoyment of work - and four aspects of organizational climate -- Work Pressure; Involvement; Supervisor Support; Co-worker Cohesion -- were considered in the reported research. The relationship between these variables revealed that aspects of the workplace environment were related to levels of both Drive and Enjoyment. Work pressure, Involvement, Co-worker Cohesion and Supervisor Support were all related to work enjoyment, with Co-worker Cohesion and Supervisor Support the strongest predictors. Only Work Pressure was related to the drive to work. Further, comparisons between two occupational groups -- Business Services (n=85); Social Services (n=66) -- revealed differences in levels of the components of workaholism. Those in the Business Services had higher Drive and lower Enjoyment than those in the Social Services. Implications for understanding and reducing workaholism are discussed.

AB  - Employees’ perceived opportunities to craft (POCs) influence actual job crafting behavior, which may have consequences for their well-being and work performance. This study aimed to validate the perceived opportunities to craft scale (POCS) in the Brazilian context. We collected data from Brazilian employees (N = 1451) in two separate samples. The factor structure, reliability, and convergent validity of the POCS were tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA), and external variables. The results indicated that the POCS-Brazilian version (with seven-point and five-point Likert scale) replicated the unidimensional structure of the original instrument. POCs showed significant positive and moderate correlations with occupational self-efficacy, work engagement and job crafting, and negative associations with workaholism. Both POCS-Brazilian versions were reliable according to three types of reliability indexes and also showed discriminant and convergent validity evidence.

AB  - Workaholism involves a reluctance to disengage from work that is evidenced by a tendency to work or think about work anytime and anywhere. Conceptual links made with the transactional model of stress suggest that workaholics focus on work at the expense of personal relationships. The present research tested the proposition that workaholics deny their workaholism and experience greater disturbances in close relationships than do non-workaholics. In addition to workers' own self-ratings, ratings from their partner or spouse were also obtained. Workaholics' ratings of their levels of enjoyment were not significantly different from their partners' ratings, but their self-ratings of drive were significantly higher than partners' ratings. Workaholic and non-workaholic dyads reported similar levels of relationship adjustment. The data indicated that workaholics' self-ratings of their level of workaholism were similar to the ratings provided by their spouse/partner, and that satisfaction with their personal relationship (with their spouse or partner) was minimally affected by workaholism. The data suggest that intimate relationships may act as stress buffers for workaholics. Implications are discussed in terms of the transactional model of stress and practices for guidance counsellors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Despite controversies about the diagnosis, the World Health Organization recently elected to include compulsive sexual behavior disorder in the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases. Both recent and remote works have suggested that various cultural factors such as personal religiousness and morality can influence both the experience and expression of compulsive sexual behaviors. Because prior works have indicated that pornography use is likely to be the most common expression of compulsive sexual behavior, the present work sought to examine whether moral incongruence about pornography use may account for a substantive part of self-reports of compulsive sexual behavior. In 2 studies involving 4 samples, the present work tested the hypothesis that moral incongruence would positively predict self-reported compulsivity in pornography use. In Study 1, across 3 samples (Sample 1, N = 467; Sample 2, N = 739; Sample 3, N = 1,461), including 2 matched to U.S. nationally representative norms (Samples 2 and 3), results indicated that moral incongruence was a substantive and robust predictor of self-reported compulsivity. In Study 2 (baseline N = 850), parallel process latent growth curve analyses over the course of 1 year revealed that the trajectories of pornography use, self-reported compulsivity, and moral disapproval of such use covaried together over time. Collectively, these results underscore the contention that personal morality may influence individuals’ self-perceptions of their sexual behaviors, which, in turn, may complicate efforts to accurately diagnose compulsive sexual behavior disorder.

AB  - This paper draws attention to the use of rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) in counselling clients who are workaholics. Essential REBT theoretical tenets can help to reveal and explain the causes of workaholic behavior, while REBT techniques can be used effectively in assisting workaholic clients to cope with their cognitive, emotive and behavioral biases. Having explained the general characteristics of workaholism, this paper utilizes a case illustration to demonstrate the basic tenets and techniques of REBT that can be used to help a workaholic client.

AB  - Workaholism, an excessive focus on work without apparent economic reason, has been conceptualized by J. T. Spence and A. S. Robbins (1992) as comprising 3 dimensions; Work Involvement (WI), Enjoyment (E), and Drive (D). The corresponding measure, the Workaholism Battery (Spence and Robbins, 1992) is widely used in workaholism research. Cluster and factor analyses in the present study of 320 employed participants failed to confirm Spence and Robbins' 3-scale model of workaholism: only E and D were apparent (α=.85 and .75, respectively). Convergent validity was demonstrated by significant correlations between E and job satisfaction (.48), between D and intrinsic job motivation (.39) and with the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality--Workaholism scale (E=.27, D=.61). Criterion validity against hours worked was weak (E=.16, D=.22, respectively). Overall, the data support the endorsement of A. Kanai et al (1996) to eliminate the Work Involvement factor in favour of a 2-factor structure of workaholism. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study compared a sample of spouses of workaholics and spouses of nonworkaholics on ratings of marital estrangement, positive feelings toward husband, and locus of control. A random national sample of 326 female participants (aged 26–89 years) drawn from the membership list of the American Counseling Association was surveyed. Spouses of workaholics reported greater marital estrangement and less positive affect towards husbands (aged 27–95 years) and higher external locus of control than spouses of nonworkaholics. These findings were the first empirical results to corroborate clinical and case study reports. Clinical implications of these findings are also presented.

AB  - Background and Aims: Internet pornography use is an increasingly common, yet controversial, behavior. Whereas mental health communities are divided about potentially problematic use patterns, many lay people identify as feeling dysregulated or compulsive in their use. Prior work has labeled this tendency perceived addiction to internet pornography (PA). This study's aims were to (1) assess the association between PA at baseline and other factors, including actual levels of average daily pornography use and personality factors and (2) assess the associations between baseline variables and PA 1 year later. Design: Two large‐scale community samples were assessed using online survey methods, with subsets of each sample being recruited for follow‐up surveys 1 year later. Setting: United States. Participants: Participants were adults who had used pornography within the past 6 months recruited in two samples. Sample 1 (n = 1507) involved undergraduate students from three US universities and sample 2 (n = 782) involved web‐using adults. Subsets of each sample (sample 1, n = 146; sample 2, n = 211) were surveyed again 1 year later. Measurements: At baseline, we assessed average daily pornography use, PA and relevant predictors (e.g. trait neuroticism, trait self‐control, trait entitlement, religiousness, moral disapproval of pornography use). One year later, we assessed PA. Findings: Cross‐sectionally, PA was correlated strongly with moral disapproval of pornography use [sample 1, Pearson's correlation: r = 0.68 (0.65, 0.70); sample 2, r = 0.58 (0.53, 0.63)]. Baseline moral disapproval [sample 1, r = 0.46 (0.33, 0.56); sample 2, r = 0.61 (0.51, 0.69)] and perceived addiction demonstrated relationships with perceived addiction 1 year later. We found inconclusive evidence of a substantial or significant association between pornography use and perceived addiction over time [sample 1, r = 0.13 (−0.02, 0.28); sample 2, r = 0.11 (−0.04, 0.25)]. Conclusions: Perceived addiction to internet pornography appears to be related strongly to moral scruples around pornography use, both concurrently and over time, rather than with the amount of daily pornography use itself.

AB  - Aims: This paper presents a critically discursive analysis of young people’s talk and drawings about mothers’ roles in their support network, contrasted with careers advisors, prior to the school to work transition. Method: Thirteen young people aged 16–19 years, opting to go into work or apprenticeships following completion of compulsory education, were interviewed up to one year prior to the school to work transition. Participants were from two educational institutions in England (one further education college; one secondary school sixth form). Participants drew support networks and discussed these during semi-structured interviews. Transcripts and drawings were analysed using a critical discursive psychological (CDP) approach. Findings: Young people’s construction of ‘support’ is an active and discursive process. Mothers were the source of support young people drew first and talked about the most. Conversely, careers advisors were absent from support network drawings and discussed ambivalently, outside the notion of ‘support’. Positioning mothers as ‘helpers’ is discussed and contrasted with careers advisors as ‘hinderers’. Limitations: Talk collected from semi-structured interviews rather than naturalistic talk could have shaped participants’ talk. All perspectives on support were from the young person’s perspective and others, such as those of family members or teachers, were not directly included in the study. Conclusions and applications: Mothers are positioned in various ways by young people in this study, overall as ‘helpers’. Careers advisors are positioned as irrelevant or ‘hinderers’. Mapping networks is suggested as a tool to support young people’s school to work transition, along with suggestions to bring practitioner psychologists from school and work domains closer together.

AB  - This study examined the differences between 2 types of workaholics (enthusiastic and nonenthusiastic workaholics) and nonworkaholic workers (work enthusiasts, relaxed workers, unengaged workers, and disenchanted workers) with respect to work–life conflict, life satisfaction, and purpose in life in a sample of 171 salaried employees of a high technology organization. Results differed for the 2 types of workaholics, supporting the importance of continued differentiation of workaholic types. Nonenthusiastic workaholics were found to have significantly more work–life conflict and significantly less life satisfaction and purpose in life than 3 of the 4 types of nonworkaholics. Enthusiastic workaholics were found to have significantly more life satisfaction and purpose in life than nonenthusiastic workaholics and significantly more work–life conflict than 3 of the 4 nonworkaholics. Implications for career planning and counseling are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the Workaholism Battery (Spence & Robbins, 1992). The original scale was translated into Turkish and then administered to 175 working graduates. Confirmatory factor analysis yielded a 2-factor solution with 9 items established in the first factor (WE) and 11 in the second (D). The reliability coefficient of the new shortened scale was .83 and the split-half reliability coefficient was .69. This scale has adequate criterion-related validity, with a positive correlation between the Jenkins Activity Survey-Type A Behavior subscale (Jenkins, Zyzanski, & Rosenman, 1979) and both WE and D. Congruence between the findings and the literature is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Despite cross-cultural differences in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptomology, little work has been extended in those in Mexico. To bridge this gap, the current study administered standardised and culturally-validated measures of OCD and a critical cultural construct – spirituality – to young adults in Mexico (n = 430) and the USA (n = 194). Linear regression analyses indicated that individuals in Mexico reported significantly greater scores on all obsessive-compulsive (OC) dimensions, when compared to those in the USA. The association between nationality and all OC symptom dimensions (except responsibility for harm) depended upon degree of spirituality; as spirituality increased, OCD severity decreased in the Mexican sample and increased in the USA sample. The potentially protective role of spirituality in Mexican participants may be explained by the collectivist culture, which can inform culturally-tailored interventions. Our study was limited by our analogue sample and cross-sectional design. Future researchers should collect longitudinal data and employ random sampling methods.

AB  - Objective: Substance use behavior is increasing in Turkey, as is the importance of substance use treatment and rehabilitation programs. Substance users’ compliance and treatment motivation are crucial for the effectiveness of treatment and rehabilitation programs. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between psychosocial variables and treatment motivation and to determine the effects of psychosocial variables, self-efficacy, and coping strategies on treatment motivation. Method: The study was conducted among 336 substance users taking part in a Cigarette, Alcohol and Drug Addiction Treatment Program (SAMBA) group program. Results: A significant difference in treatment motivation was found according to the individual’s age, educational status, and income level, duration of substance use and number of substances used, family problems, and psychiatric comorbidity. In addition, the most important predictive variables for treatment motivation are the individual’s income level, the presence of children, family problems, and coping strategies. Conclusion: Cognitive and behavioral studies should be undertaken to strengthen social support mechanisms, to increase the supportive participation of family members, and to develop coping strategies as well as motivational techniques in order to increase the individuals’ compliance and motivation.

AB  - Given the prevalence of sex addiction (SA) among collegiate populations, the authors designed this study to examine college counselors' training in SA, use of formal assessments, and referrals to support groups. Results indicated that 84.4% of college counselors (N = 77) had at least one client present with SA‐related issues in the past year. Findings suggest the need for improvement in counselor training in SA, use of formal assessments, and referral practices. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Work craving theory addresses how work-addicted individuals direct great emotion-regulatory efforts to weave their addictive web of working. They crave work for two main emotional incentives: to overcompensate low self-worth and to escape (i.e., reduce) negative affect, which is strategically achieved through neurotic perfectionism and compulsive working. Work-addicted individuals' strong persistence and self-discipline with respect to work-related activities suggest strong skills in volitional action control. However, their inability to disconnect from work implies low volitional skills. How can work-addicted individuals have poor and strong volitional skills at the same time? To answer this paradox, we elaborated on the relevance of two different volitional modes in work craving: self-regulation (self-maintenance) and self-control (goal maintenance). Four hypotheses were derived from Wojdylo's work craving theory and Kuhl's self-regulation theory: (H1) Work craving is associated with a combination of low self-regulation and high self-control. (H2) Work craving is associated with symptoms of psychological distress. (H3) Low self-regulation is associated with psychological distress symptoms. (H4) Work craving mediates the relationships between self-regulation deficits and psychological distress symptoms at high levels of self-control. Additionally, we aimed at supporting the discriminant validity of work craving with respect to work engagement by showing their different volitional underpinnings. Results of the two studies confirmed our hypotheses: whereas work craving was predicted by high self-control and low self-regulation and associated with higher psychological distress, work engagement was predicted by high self-regulation and high self-control and associated with lower symptoms of psychological distress. Furthermore, work styles mediated the relationship between volitional skills and symptoms of psychological distress. Based on these new insights, several suggestions for prevention and therapeutic interventions for work-addicted individuals are proposed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Assessed the concept of workaholism (defined as high work involvement and drive and low enjoyment of work) and contrasted this profile with work enthusiasm (defined as high work involvement and enjoyment and low drive). 134 male and 157 female social workers with academic positions completed workaholism questionnaires. Psychometric properties of the scales are described. Cluster analyses for each sex revealed groups who corresponded to the workaholic and work enthusiast profiles as well as several other profiles. Workaholics were higher than work enthusiasts on measures of perfectionism, nondelegation of responsibility, and job stress. Workaholics were also higher on a measure of health complaints.

AB  - This study assessed the relationship between work-family conflict, work engagement, workaholism and turnover intention in business executives. 275 professionals (65.4% men) completed an online survey containing scales to assess work-family conflict, workaholism, work engagement and turnover intention. Descriptive and inferential statistics were conducted, as well as network and pathway analysis. Partial correlations between the workaholism dimension 'working excessively' (WE) and work-family conflict (WFC) were r = .21. WE also predicted WFC (χ² = 26.24, df = 7, p < .001; CFI = .95; RMSEA = .10 (.06 - .14), particularly in terms of work interfering in family life, leading to higher turnover intention and reduced work engagement. Model estimates show variations according to gender. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Object: The neurosurgical community is particularly exposed to burnout. The objectives of this study were to report the prevalence and associated factors of burnout within the French neurosurgical community using validated academic and psychologic scales. Methods: A national survey was sent to 141 French residents and 432 neurosurgeons between April and July 2019. Burnout was surveyed using the Maslach burnout inventory. The survey included demographic data and several academic psychologic scales. A stepwise multiple regression was used to determine factors that are associated with burnout scores. Results: The response rate was 100% and 23.6% for residents and neurosurgeons, respectively. Prevalence of burnout within the French neurosurgical community was 49%. There were no significant differences between residents and neurosurgeons. Two categories of factors were associated with the main dimensions of burnout during the stepwise multiple regression: personality and factors related with neurosurgical practice. Personality types such as neuroticism were negatively associated with burnout while agreeableness was protective. Work addictive profile with excessive work and absorption at work were negatively associated. Factors associated with neurosurgical practice such as conflict of work into family life, unbalanced effort to reward ratio, work duration were negatively associated. Pleasure at work was protective. Conclusion: Prevalence of burnout is high among French neurosurgeons. Predictive models can be used to identify and prevent burnout among profiles at risk.

AB  - We used and integrated the circumplex model of affect (Russell, 1980) and the conservation of resources theory (Hobfoll, 1998) to hypothesize how various types of employee well-being, which can be differentiated on theoretical grounds (i.e., work engagement, job satisfaction, burnout, and workaholism), may differently predict various job crafting behaviors (i.e., increasing structural and social resources and challenging demands, and decreasing hindering demands) and each other over time. At Time 1, we measured employee well-being, and 4 years later at Time 2, job crafting and well-being, using a large sample of Finnish dentists (N = 1,877). The results of structural equation modeling showed that (a) work engagement positively predicted both types of increasing resources and challenging demands and negatively predicted decreasing hindering demands; (b) workaholism positively predicted increasing structural resources and challenging demands; (c) burnout positively predicted decreasing hindering demands and negatively predicted increasing structural resources, whereas (d) job satisfaction did not relate to job crafting over time; and (e) work engagement positively influenced job satisfaction and negatively influenced burnout, whereas (f) workaholism predicted burnout after controlling for baseline levels. Thus, work engagement was a stronger predictor of future job crafting and other types of employee well-being than job satisfaction. Although workaholism was positively associated with job crafting, it also predicted burnout. We conclude that the relationship between job crafting and employee well-being may be more complex than assumed, because the way in which employees will craft their jobs in the future seems to depend on how they currently feel.

AB  - In a follow-up to our work on the dependence of walking dyad dynamics on intrinsic properties of the group, we now analyse how these properties affect groups of three people (triads), taking also in consideration the effect of social interaction on the dynamical properties of the group. We show that there is a strong parallel between triads and dyads. Work-oriented groups are faster and walk at a larger distance between them than leisure-oriented ones, while the latter move in a less ordered way. Such differences are present also when colleagues are contrasted with friends and families; nevertheless the similarity between friend and colleague behaviour is greater than the one between family and colleague behaviour. Male triads walk faster than triads including females, males keep a larger distance than females, and same gender groups are more ordered than mixed ones. Groups including tall people walk faster, while those with elderly or children walk at a slower pace. Groups including children move in a less ordered fashion. Results concerning relation and gender are particularly strong, and we investigated whether they hold also when other properties are kept fixed. While this is clearly true for relation, patterns relating gender often resulted to be diminished. For instance, the velocity difference due to gender is reduced if we compare only triads in the colleague relation. The effects on group dynamics due to intrinsic properties are present regardless of social interaction, but socially interacting groups are found to walk in a more ordered way. This has an opposite effect on the space occupied by non-interacting dyads and triads, since loss of structure makes dyads larger, but causes triads to lose their characteristic V formation and walk in a line (i.e., occupying more space in the direction of movement but less space in the orthogonal one).

AB  - Although electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use has increased among adults in the United States, there is still little knowledge of factors that may influence e-cigarette use or beliefs about use. Prior research suggests that health literacy plays an important role in e-cigarette beliefs, including perceived benefits and risks of e-cigarette use, as well as e-cigarette dependence. Yet, limited work has examined risk factors of poor e-cigarette health literacy. From a biopsychological perspective, sex and pain severity represent two constructs that may impact e-cigarette health literacy. To date, however, no research has investigated differences in e-cigarette health literacy across pain, sex, or their interrelation. Thus, the present study was conducted to evaluate the interactive effect of pain severity and sex on e-cigarette health literacy. Participants included 319 current, adult e-cigarette users (60.5% female, Mage = 36.82 years, SD = 10.62). Findings supported a significant pain by sex interaction, such that pain related to e-cigarette health literacy among women (b = .10, SE = .03, P < .001), but not men (b = .01, SE = .03, P = .60). The present findings suggest that pain may uniquely impact the degree to which women, but not men, seek and understand information on e-cigarettes.

AB  - Addiction to opioids is an important global problem. Published research has indicated the powerful rewarding effects of drug use, which in the case of opiates like morphine may lead to drug addiction and maladaptive decision making with negative social consequences. In-depth comprehension of the role of responsible mechanisms in addiction can lead us to better and more effective treatments for drug dependence. Continuing previous work in our laboratory, in this study we aimed to investigate the role of dopamine D1- and D2-like receptors in the dentate gyrus (DG) on the reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior induced by the combination of forced swim stress and a subthreshold dose of morphine on extinguished morphine-conditioned place preference in rats. The rats were bilaterally implanted with 2 separate cannulas into the DG region. After the extinction phase of morphine–conditioned place preference, the animals received different doses (0.5, 2, and 4 μg per 0.5 μL vehicle/side) of SCH-23390 or sulpiride on the reinstatement day and were tested for the combination of forced swim stress and a subthreshold dose of morphine in discrete groups. Our findings indicated that D1- and D2-like receptor antagonists attenuated the reinstatement induced by the combination of FSS and the subthreshold dose of morphine. The reduction was more robust in groups of animals that received sulpiride as compared with SCH-23390. Our results showed a role for DG dopamine receptors in relapse to drugs of abuse, the activity of which may be induced by exposure to a stressor like forced swim stress.

AB  - This article explores the operation of gender and industrial relations in long‐term care work or nursing home work, ‘from within’ the experience of the predominantly female workforce in seven unionized facilities in Canada. Drawing on qualitative case study data in non‐profit facilities, the article argues that the main industrial relations challenges facing long‐term care workers are that their workplace priorities do not fit within existing, gendered, industrial relations processes and institutions. This article starts from the experience of women and threads this experience through other layers of social organization such as: global and local policy directions including austerity, New Public Management, and social and healthcare funding; industrial relations mechanisms and policy; and workers’ formal [union] and informal efforts to represent their interests in the workplace. The strongest themes in the reported experience of the women include: manufacturing conditions for unpaid work; increasing management and state dependence on unpaid care work; fostering loose boundaries; and limiting respect and autonomy as aspects of care work. The article extends the feminist political economy by analysing the links between the policies noted above and frontline care work. Building on gendered organizational theory the article also introduces the concept of non‐job work and suggests a fourth industrial relations institution, namely the needs and gendered expectations of residents, families and workers themselves, operating within the liminal spaces in care work.

AB  - Missing data arise in many statistical analyses, due to faults in data acquisition, and can have a significant effect on the conclusions that can be drawn from the data. In environmental data, for example, a standard approach usually adopted by the Environmental Protection Agencies to handle missing values is by deleting those observations with incomplete information from the study, obtaining a massive underestimation of many indexes usually used for evaluating air quality. In multivariate time series, moreover, it may happen that not only isolated values but also long sequences of some of the time series’ components may miss. In such cases, it is quite impossible to reconstruct the missing sequences basing on the serial dependence structure alone. In this work, we propose a new procedure that aims to reconstruct the missing sequences by exploiting the spatial correlation and the serial correlation of the multivariate time series, simultaneously. The proposed procedure is based on a spatial-dynamic model and imputes the missing values in the time series basing on a linear combination of the neighbor contemporary observations and their lagged values. It is specifically oriented to spatio-temporal data, although it is general enough to be applied to generic stationary multivariate time-series. In this paper, the procedure has been applied to the pollution data, where the problem of missing sequences is of serious concern, with remarkably satisfactory performance.

AB  - Background: Many health professionals lack adequate training needed to effectively address alcohol and other drug (AOD)-related problems. Building upon our previously successful in-person faculty training programs, we designed and pilot tested the brief online Faculty Education in Addiction Training (FEAT) Program for social work and internal medicine residency faculty. The present study examines baseline and post-FEAT Program AOD knowledge and teaching confidence and preparedness among faculty participants. Methods: The FEAT Program curriculum included didactic videos, online engagement with content experts, recommended readings, and a live virtual classroom experience. Participants completed self-assessments of knowledge and teaching confidence and preparedness pre- and post-FEAT program. Results: In this pilot test, thirty faculty completed the FEAT program: 15 social work and 15 internal medical residency program faculty. Both groups showed significant improvement (p < 0.001) in overall AOD-related knowledge with medium-to-large effects (Cohen’s d = 1.83 [social work], 0.72 [medicine]). Both groups showed significant increases in teaching confidence (p < 0.001) for all items with large effects (Cohen’s d values range from 1.08 to 1.92) and significant increases and large effects for all teaching preparedness items for social work (at least p < 0.01 | Cohen’s d range = 1.03–1.56) and internal medical residency faculty (p < 0.001 | Cohen’s d range = 1.08–1.69). Conclusions: Multidisciplinary health professions educators’ AOD knowledge and teaching confidence and preparedness can be improved by participation in a brief online program designed to circumvent the logistical and fiscal challenges presented by in-person programs.

AB  - Introduction: Problematic use of video games, social media, and Internet-related activities may be associated with sleep deprivation and poor work performance. The Internet Addiction Test was given to military medical and nursing students and housestaff to assess problematic Internet use. Methods: Medical and nursing students at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and residents from Naval Medical Center San Diego were contacted via email (n = 1,000) and given a survey that included the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and questions asking about other specific lifestyle variables. Individuals who received an Internet Addiction Score (IAS) ≥50 were identified as likely experiencing harmful effects of Internet addiction (IA). Results: Of 399 surveys submitted, 68 were omitted due to gross incompletion or failing to finish the entirety of the IAT. Of the participants included, 205 (61.1%) were male and 125 (37.9%) were female. The mean age was 28.6 years old (S.D. = 5.1 years). In regards to training status, completed surveys were assessed for 94 medical residents, 221 School of Medicine students, and 16 Graduate School of Nursing students. Our survey showed 5.5% of the participants (n = 18) indicated problems with Internet use that are concerning for IA. Conclusions: The study results indicated that our population showed problematic Internet use in the lower range of global estimates of IA. Rates of IA further decreased between medical students and residents. Multiple lifestyle variables were significantly associated with IA score and may serve as indicators of a higher score. Interestingly, the use of social media during sleeping hours was most significantly associated with increased IAS. This paper discusses IA among military medical and nursing trainees and how problematic Internet use may affect work performance and force readiness.

AB  - The current study introduces an ultra-short, 3-item version of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale. Using five national samples from Finland (N = 22,117), Japan (N = 1,968), the Netherlands (N = 38,278), Belgium/Flanders (N = 5,062), and Spain (N = 10,040) its internal consistency and factorial validity vis-à-vis validated measures of burnout, workaholism, and job boredom are demonstrated. Moreover, the UWES-3 shares 86–92% of its variance with the longer nine-item version and the pattern of correlations of both versions with 9 indicators of well-being, 8 job demands, 10 job resources, and 6 outcomes is highly similar with an average, absolute difference between correlations of only .02. Hence, it is concluded that the UWES-3 is a reliable and valid indicator of work engagement that can be used as an alternative to the longer version, for instance in national and international epidemiological surveys on employee’s working conditions.

AB  - In rats, continuous cocaine access during long self‐administration sessions (6 versus 1–2 hours) promotes the development of behavioral symptoms of addiction. This has led to the assumption that taking large amounts of drug during extended daily bouts is necessary to develop an addiction phenotype. Recent work shows that within‐session intermittent access (IntA) to cocaine produces much less drug intake than continuous‐access procedures (i.e. long‐access sessions) but evokes addiction symptoms more effectively. IntA‐sessions are also long, typically lasting 6 hours. It is not known whether IntA‐sessions must be extended to promote addiction‐relevant changes in drug use over time. Here, we determined the influence of IntA‐session length on patterns of cocaine use relevant to addiction. Two groups of male Wistar rats self‐administered cocaine (0.25 mg/kg/injection, injected over 5 seconds) during 18 daily IntA‐sessions. One group had long 6‐hour sessions (Long‐IntA), the other group had shorter, 2‐hour sessions (Short‐IntA). Only Long‐IntA rats escalated their cocaine intake over sessions, but both groups developed a burst‐like pattern of drug use over time and similar levels of psychomotor sensitization. The two groups also showed robust and similar levels of both responding for cocaine under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement and cocaine‐induced reinstatement of extinguished drug‐seeking behavior. In summary, long IntA‐sessions lead to greater cocaine intake than shorter IntA‐sessions, but the two conditions are equally effective in evoking the patterns of drug‐taking and drug‐seeking that define addiction. This suggests that chronic intermittent cocaine use, even during short daily bouts, is sufficient to promote addiction symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The current study evaluated the continuity between the diagnostic operationalizations of obsessive–compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, both as traditionally operationalized and from the perspective of the alternative model of personality disorders. Using both self-report and informant measures, the study had the following four aims: (a) to examine the extent to which self-report and informant data correspond, (b) to investigate whether both self-report and informant measures of the alternative model of OCPD can predict traditional OCPD, (c) to determine if any traits additional to those proposed in the alternative model of OCPD can predict traditional OCPD, and (d) to investigate whether a measure of OCPD-specific impairment is better at predicting traditional OCPD than are measures of general impairment in personality functioning. A mental health sample of 214 participants was recruited and administered measures of both the traditional and alternative models of OCPD. Self-report data moderately corresponded with informant data, which is consistent with the literature. Results further confirmed rigid perfectionism as the core trait of OCPD. Perseveration and workaholism were also associated with OCPD. Hostility was identified as a trait deserving further research. A measure of OCPD-specific impairment demonstrated its ability to incrementally predict OCPD over general measures of impairment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Studies of workers who engage in excessive work behaviour continue to attract the attention of researchers. Most research in this field adheres to quantitative methodologies aligned to the addiction or trait paradigms and largely focuses on correlates and consequences of such behaviour. However, within this literature, empirically based understandings of the factors that propel individuals to engage in excessive work patterns are sparse. Resting on socio‐cultural theories of work, we adopt a novel approach to this field of enquiry and examine the genesis of excessive working using a qualitative methodology. We use discourse analysis to comparatively explore data from a sample of twenty‐eight workers comprising excessive and non‐excessive workers. Our study identified the roles of family of origin, educational experience, and professional norms as clear drivers of excessive work patterns. Data to support the dominant addiction and trait paradigms within this research domain were equivocal. Lifestyle decision‐making differentiated the comparison group from the excessive workers. We discuss our findings with reference to theories of workaholism and consider their implications for the evolution of this field. Practitioner points Organizational culture can strongly influence the emergence of excessive work patterns among employees. Human resource professionals and organizational leaders are in a position to intervene in the development and support of work cultures that are conducive to effective work patterns Employee selection and assessment procedures should be sufficiently in‐depth to gather relevant information into the personal backgrounds of applicants Employee development initiatives should take account of learned work orientations to ensure the effectiveness of interventions.

AB  - Social workers are needed to implement science-based treatments for alcohol and other drug (AOD) problems. Changes in insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act will increase the demand for licensed Master of Social Work (MSW) clinicians. This national study of MSW programs (N = 210) examines prevalence of addiction courses and specializations. Web-based analyses showed that only 14.3% of accredited schools offered specialization; only 4.7% of accredited schools had one or more required courses. Social work education has not met addiction workforce development needs; there is no evidence this pattern will change. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study aimed to investigate whether certain aspects of the God image, and characteristics of attachment to God, can be related to work addiction risk. The sample consisted of 215 Hungarian adults (mean age 37.9). Regarding the two measured aspects of the God image, the Loving God image was linked with work addiction risk through its weak negative contribution to self-esteem, whereas the Controlling God image was in a weak direct association with work addiction risk. Anxiety about abandonment by God showed a strong positive correlation with work addiction risk, and also predicted it negatively through self-esteem. The results suggest that anxious attachment to God might contribute to work addiction risk. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The current study examined Spence and Robbins' (1992) worker types in terms of correlates of workaholism (e.g., work-life imbalance, obsessive-compulsive behavior). A survey was administered to professionals, who were then classified into different worker types following the traditional median-split technique. The data were also analyzed with three composite variables that capture the worker types in a continuous fashion. The results of the correlation analysis with the composites were similar to those obtained with the median-split approach. Specifically, workaholics had higher levels of work-life imbalance than work enthusiasts, whereas unengaged workers and relaxed workers had low levels; workaholics and positively engaged workers had high levels of obsessive-compulsive behavior, whereas work enthusiasts, unengaged workers, and relaxed workers showed low levels.

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 160(2) of The Journal of Social Psychology (see record [rid]2020-10224-001[/rid]). When the original article was first published online, the Appendix tables were not included with the text. Correct tables are present in the erratum.] We investigate the intersection of social media and the workplace, focusing on job performance impacts of employees’ social media addictions and social media reactions through work–family balance and burnout. The research model is grounded in conservation of resources theory, which suggests social media compulsions and emotional reactions to co-worker’s social media posts will deplete employees’ energetic and constructive resources, making it difficult to achieve work-family balance and increasing the likelihood of job burnout, and will ultimately degrade job performance. A sample of 326 full-time employees revealed a negative relationship between social media addiction and work-family balance and a positive relationship between social media reactions and job burnout. Balance and burnout mediated the relationship between social media and job performance such that social media addiction was negatively related to job performance through work–family balance, and social media reactions were negatively related to performance through burnout and work–family conflict.

AB  - The high prevalence of smoking among persons with mental illness and co-occurring substance use disorders has not changed in the past decade despite a decline in smoking among the general population. Interprofessional collaborative care offers clinicians the opportunity to engage their patients in tobacco cessation treatment that is coordinated and comprehensive. Investigators applied a 1-group, pre/post-test design with qualitative and quantitative descriptive analyses to estimate the impact of an interprofessional tobacco education program on perceived self-efficacy and self-reported counseling abilities of graduate nursing, social work, and pharmacy (PharmD) students (N = 36; nursing, n = 13, n = 9 PharmD, n = 14 social work) to treat tobacco dependence among this subpopulation of smokers, and to assess their perceptions of interprofessional education. All participants completed a 2-h web-based module, a 3-h classroom training, a simulation with a standardized patient, and a group audio-recorded debriefing session with faculty. Emergent themes from qualitative analyses were valuing simulations, demystifying disciplines, reflecting on and critiquing practice, and lessons learned. Participants’ perceived self-efficacy, self-rated counseling ability, intention to ask about tobacco use, and intention to provide counseling for tobacco cessation increased significantly. Teaching students an interprofessional team approach appears to be effective in enhancing counseling abilities and self-efficacy and may positively influence health professions students’ perceptions of interprofessional education. Larger studies are recommended to validate the results of this pilot study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In recent years, an increasing number of young adults have difficulties making a smooth transition to adulthood in becoming romantically committed and balancing romantic commitments and other aspects of life. The present study was conducted on a sample of 100 Israeli emerging adults (54 males) who were followed from age 23 to 34 years. The study examined the role of personality attributes (dependency, self-criticism), parental support, and reflectivity concerning own family of origin in making a smoother transition to mature romantic engagement. Greater achievement of romantic goals and greater mastery in balancing family and work demands were predicted by low dependency or low self-criticism (assessed at age 23) and a high level of reflectivity (assessed at age 29). The distinctive role of reflectivity with regard to own family script and personality attributes for a smoother romantic transition in adulthood is discussed. In addition, the possible implications of the findings for intervention are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, in conjunction with key Canadian stakeholders, has developed a guideline outlining 18 core competencies for those working with clients with addiction issues. The curriculum of Canada's 35 faculties and schools of social work were examined using the core competencies to determine the extent of addiction education received by undergraduate and graduate social work students. All social work addiction courses were elective offerings, although faculty teaching in this area did express a desire to shift the focus of addiction studies away from elective to core course offerings. The majority of competency-based education at the faculties and schools of social work is taught at a generalist level, and graduate schools of social work teach fewer core addiction competencies than undergraduate. Although competency-based education is generally viewed positively and adopted at faculties and schools of social work, only one third of addiction courses matched with the 18 core competencies developed through the auspices of the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse.

AB  - Among young people who start using prescription pain relievers (PPRs) for feeling-states such as 'to get high' or otherwise beyond boundaries intended by prescribers, the most recent epidemiological incidence estimates show 2%–9% with rapid-onset opioid dependence. In this work, we study recently active underage alcohol dependence as a susceptibility marker and estimate alcohol dependence-associated PPR rates of use, once use starts. In recent U.S. epidemiological samples, we identified 16,125 community-dwelling 12-to-20-year-olds with standardized assessments of both problem drinking and newly incident extra-medical PPR use. We applied zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regressions to estimate (a) alcohol dependence associations with susceptibility-to-persist after the very first occasion of extra-medical PPR use, and (b) the rate of PPR use, conditional on persistence. Underage drinkers with alcohol dependence were more susceptible to persistence in their extra-medical PPR use (p < .001). In addition, given susceptibility-to-persistence, there was an alcohol dependence-associated excess rate of extra-medical PPR use (risk ratio = 1.3; 95% confidence interval = 1.1, 1.6). Using ZIP regressions, we can see that underage alcohol dependence signals membership in a susceptible-to-persistence class of extra-medical PPR users and excess rates of extra-medical use. Underage drinking can be an indicator of greater vulnerability to start and persist in extra-medical use of PPR, particularly if presenting clinical features of alcohol dependence already are seen at or near time of first onset of such PPR use. For alcohol dependence-affected adolescent patients, nondrug pain management plans deserve consideration, with special surveillance if analgesic drugs are prescribed. Implications for genetic susceptibility research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Previous research has suggested that Facebook use can lead to adverse romantic relationship outcomes due to interpersonal conflicts, interactions with potential romantic alternatives, and jealousy. However, these associations have been explored mainly with undergraduates, focusing primarily on conflict rather than emotional disengagement. The current study examined the associations between Facebook addiction and marital disaffection (e.g., loss of love, emotional disengagement) amongst 138 (95 females and 43 males) cohabiting married Facebook users residing in the United States. The results revealed that Facebook addiction and marital disaffection were positively related, even after controlling for relationship commitment. Additionally, greater relationship commitment weakened the association between Facebook addiction and marital disaffection. There are likely multiple explanations for the current findings; however, results suggest that higher levels of relationship commitment may protect spouses against the negative relationship outcomes associated with Facebook addiction. Future longitudinal work with couples is needed to clarify the directionality of the relationship between Facebook addiction and marital disaffection.

AB  - Highly processed foods (e.g., pizza, chocolate) have been more associated with indicators of food addiction than have minimally processed foods (e.g., fruits, vegetables), although findings have been primarily self-reported. The present study utilized behavioral methods from the addiction literature to assess whether (a) foods differ in their associations with subjective experience indicators of abuse liability and (b) individual differences in subjective experiences and eating behavior emerge using the Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (YFAS 2.0). Women (n = 44) with overweight or obesity, 38.6% with YFAS 2.0 food addiction, rated facets of subjective experience (e.g., craving) during a taste test task and ad libitum consumption period. A hierarchical linear model assessed whether foods were differentially associated with each subjective experience (Level 1) and individual differences by food addiction (Level 2). Associations between subjective experiences and eating behavior were also examined. Highly processed, relative to minimally processed, foods were more associated with indicators of abuse liability, although individuals with food addiction reported decreased enjoyment for and intentions to consume highly processed foods. Subjective experiences were associated with greater consumption of highly processed foods for participants with food addiction. The present work provides further support for the rewarding nature of highly processed foods, evidenced by closer associations with subjective experiences reported for drugs of abuse compared to minimally processed foods. In addition, highly processed food intake was related to elevated subjective experience reports for these foods for those with food addiction, paralleling findings in individuals with a substance-use disorder for the relevant drug.

AB  - The main aim of this study was to explore the mediating role of learning engagement on the relationship between social networking site (SNS) addiction and academic achievement among 406 university students. The Social Networking Site Addiction Scale, Utrecht Work Engagement Scale for Students, and Chinese Students Academic Achievement Scale were used to evaluate students’ SNS addiction, learning engagement, and academic achievement. Correlation analysis indicated that SNS addiction, learning engagement, and academic achievement were significantly correlated with each other. The causal steps regression and bootstrap analysis show that learning engagement mediated the relationship between SNS addiction and academic achievement. Implications for research and instructions for how to improve university students’ academic achievement are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Self-efficacy has repeatedly been demonstrated to be a robust predictor of outcomes in the treatment of marijuana use disorders. It is not clear, however, how increases in confidence in ability to refrain from use get translated into actual improvements in drug-related outcomes. Marlatt, among others, viewed the acquisition and use of coping skills as the key to behavior change, and self-efficacy as a cognitive state that enabled coping. But that model of behavior change has not been supported, and few studies have shown that the effects of self-efficacy are mediated by coping or by other processes. The current study combined 3 marijuana treatment trials comprising 901 patients to examine the relationships between self-efficacy, coping, and potential mediators, to determine if the effects of self-efficacy on outcomes could be explained. Results of multilevel models indicated that self-efficacy was a strong predictor of adaptive outcomes in all trials, even when no active treatment was provided. Tests of mediation showed that effects of self-efficacy on marijuana use and on marijuana-related problems were partially mediated by use of coping skills and by reductions in emotional distress, but that direct effects of self-efficacy remained largely unexplained. The results are seen as supportive of efforts to improve coping skills and reduce distress in marijuana treatment, but also suggest that additional research is required to discover what is actually occurring when substance use changes, and how self-efficacy enables those changes.

AB  - Purpose: This study presented the construct of Work–Health Balance (WHB) and the design and validation of the Work–Health Balance Questionnaire (WHBq). More and more workers have a long-standing health problem or disability (LSHPD). The management of health needs and work demands is crucial for the quality of working life and work retention of these workers. However, no instrument exists measuring this process. The WHBq assesses key factors in the process of adjusting between health needs and work demands. Method: We tested the reliability and validity of 38 items with cross-sectional data from a sample of 321 Italian workers (mean age = 45 ± 11 years) using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), Rasch analyses, and the correlations with other relevant variables. Results: The instrument ultimately consisted of 17 items that reliably measured three factors: work–health incompatibility, health climate, and external support. These dimensions were associated with well-being in the workplace, dysfunctional behaviors at work, and general psychological health. A higher level on the WHB index was associated with lower levels of presenteeism, emotional exhaustion, workaholism, and psychological distress and with higher levels of job satisfaction and work engagement, supporting the construct validity of the instrument. Conclusion: The WHBq shows good psychometric characteristics and strong and theoretically consistent relationships with important and well-known variables. These results make the WHBq a promising tool in the study and management of health of employees, especially for the work continuation of employees returning to work with LSHPD.

AB  - Impact and Implications—Although there exist studies about job retention of workers with long-standing health problem or disability (LSHPD), no theory and no specific tool has been provided. This study is the first proposal of a theory and a tool about long-term job retention of workers with LSHPD. The study supports the centrality of the Work–Health Balance (WHB) in determining long-term job retention or premature job loss of workers with LSHPD and validates a questionnaire assessing the key elements of the WHB: work–health incompatibility, health climate, and external support. Vocational rehabilitation professionals and human resource management (HRM) staff should consider the use of the WHB questionnaire to monitor and adjust the process of work reintegration and work continuation of employees returning to work with LSHPD.

AB  - Background: Although the occupational health field has identified psychosocial factors as risk factors for low back pain that causes disability, the association between disabling low back pain and psychosocial factors has not been examined adequately in Japanese hospital workers. Therefore, this study examined the association between low back pain, which interfered with work, and psychosocial factors in Japanese hospital workers. Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a hospital in Japan. In total, 280 hospital workers were recruited from various occupational settings. Of these, 203 completed a self-administered questionnaire that included items concerning individual characteristics, severity of low back pain, fear-avoidance beliefs (Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire), somatic symptoms (Somatic Symptom Scale-8), psychological distress (K6), workaholism, and work-related psychosocial factors (response rate: 72.5%). Logistic regression was used to explore risk factors associated with disabling low back pain. Results: Of the 203 participants who completed questionnaires, 36 (17.7%) reported low back pain that interfered with their work. Multivariate analyses with individual factors and occupations adjusted for showed statistically significant associations between disabling low back pain and fear-avoidance beliefs (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2.619, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.003 ± 6.538], somatic symptoms (OR: 4.034, 95% CI: 1.819 ± 9.337), and interpersonal stress at work (OR: 2.619, 95% CI: 1.067 ± 6.224). Conclusions: Psychosocial factors, such as fear-avoidance beliefs, somatic symptoms, and interpersonal relationships at work, were important risk factors in low back pain that interfered with work in Japanese hospital workers. With respect to occupational health, consideration of psychosocial factors is required to reduce disability related to low back pain. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - At present, the scientific community has not reached a consensus regarding whether or not people may be become addicted to or compulsive in use of pornography. Even so, a substantial number of people report feeling that their use of pornography is dysregulated or out of control. Whereas prior works considered self-reported feelings of addiction via indirect scales or dimensional measures, the present work examined what might lead someone to specifically identify as a pornography addict. Consistent with prior research, pre-registered hypotheses predicted that religiousness, moral disapproval, and average daily pornography use would emerge as consistent predictors of self-identification as a pornography addict. Four samples, involving adult pornography users (Sample 1, N = 829, Mage = 33.3; SD = 9.4; Sample 2, N = 424, Mage = 33.6; SD = 9.1; Sample 4, N = 736, Mage = 48.0; SD = 15.8) and undergraduates (Sample 3, N = 231, Mage = 19.3; SD = 1.8), were collected. Across all three samples, male gender, moral incongruence, and average daily pornography use consistently emerged as predictors of self-identification as a pornography addict. In contrast to prior literature indicating that moral incongruence and religiousness are the best predictors of self-reported feelings of addiction (measured dimensionally), results from all four samples indicated that male gender and average daily pornography use were the most strongly associated with self-identification as a pornography addict, although moral incongruence consistently emerged as a robust and unique predictors of such self-identification.

AB  - Behavioral systems and emotional regulation are key components of adolescents’ emotional development. However, little is known about their role in addiction potential. This research was conducted to evaluate the role of behavioral inhibition systems (BIS), behavioral activation systems (BAS) and difficulty with emotional regulation (DER) in adolescents’ addiction potential. The present work is applied correlative research. The 1,900 participants included male adolescents from high schools in the north, south, east, and west of Tehran were the society of this research. The sample was randomly selected by using Morgan’s table for as many as 320 students. The entry criteria were gender, age, grade of education, and non-drug abuse. The research measures were behavioral activation and inhibition systems scales, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, as well as the Addiction Prone Personality scale. The results showed the correlations among BIS, BAS, and DER were positively significant (p < .05). The correlation between BIS and addiction potential was significantly negative (p < .05). Finally, BAS, BIS, and DER, respectively, predicted 57%, 20%, and 22% of the addiction potential?s variance. According to the findings, BAS is the best predictor of the addiction potential. It seems that reward responding and seeking pleasure, which were behavioral activation systems subscales, and DER most contributed to predicting addiction potential.

AB  - Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons are key components of the reward pathway, and their activity is powerfully controlled by a diverse array of inhibitory GABAergic inputs. Two major sources of GABAergic nerve terminals within the VTA are local VTA interneurons and neurons in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg). Here, using optogenetics, we compared synaptic properties of GABAergic synapses on VTA dopamine neurons using selective activation of afferents that originate from these two cell populations. We found little evidence of co‐release of glutamate from either input, but RMTg‐originating synaptic currents were reduced by strychnine, suggesting co‐release of glycine and GABA. VTA‐originating synapses displayed a lower initial release probability, and at higher frequency stimulation, short‐term depression was more marked in VTA‐ but not RMTg‐originating synapses. We previously reported that nitric oxide (NO)‐induced potentiation of GABAergic synapses on VTA dopaminergic cells is lost after exposure to drugs of abuse or acute stress; in these experiments, multiple GABAergic afferents were simultaneously activated by electrical stimulation. Here we found that optogenetically‐activated VTA‐originating synapses on presumptive dopamine neurons also exhibited NO‐induced potentiation, whereas RMTg‐originating synapses did not. Despite providing a robust inhibitory input to the VTA, RMTg GABAergic synapses are most likely not those previously shown by our work to be persistently altered by addictive drugs and stress. Our work emphasises the idea that dopamine neuron excitability is controlled by diverse inhibitory inputs expected to exert varying degrees of inhibition and to participate differently in a range of behaviours.

AB  - Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is an indigenous plant known for its traditional medicinal use, and for its addiction potential, in Southeast Asia. In recent years, kratom and its major alkaloid, mitragynine, spread worldwide with largely unknown effects on behavior and mental health. Recent studies show that kratom use can lead to dependence and that mitragynine works as an addictive drug in animal studies. Nevertheless, kratom preparations were also suggested as a less harmful substitute in opiate withdrawal. Potential side-effects of prolonged kratom use, however, are currently unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the social functioning of regular kratom users in Malaysia. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in three northern states of Peninsular Malaysia investigating 293 regular kratom consumers using the Addiction Severity Index in a snowball sampling technique. Findings showed that regular kratom users do not experience major impairments in their social functioning, despite being dependent on kratom for prolonged periods. Our findings suggest that chronic kratom administration does not significantly impair social functioning of users in a natural context in Malaysia.

AB  - Traits under strong directional selection are predicted to be condition dependent and thus increase in development when an organism acquires more resources. This prediction has been tested for a variety of traits, particularly those under precopulatory sexual selection. However, few studies compare the condition dependence of a variety of phenotypic traits, potentially subject to different selective forces. Here we examine the condition dependence of several important life history traits, including those under both pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection, in the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor. We manipulated condition by randomly assigning larvae to one of high-, medium- or low-quality diets. For males reared on the three diets, we measured the following: (a) adult body size and lifespan, (b) pheromone attractiveness, (c) weight of their ejaculate transferred to females and (d) fecundity of their female mates. Males raised on a high-quality diet were larger and lived longer than males raised on medium- and low-quality diets. Although females were significantly attracted to male pheromones, there were no significant differences amongst condition treatments in male attractiveness nor ejaculate transfer. Furthermore, mates’ fecundity was also not affected by male condition. We discuss these results considering previous work on trade-offs and condition dependence of life history traits. Significance statement: Theory suggests that traits that are under strong selection should be sensitive to the amount of resources an organism has available (i.e. dependent on condition), such that when those resources are plentiful, then these traits should increase disproportionately to other traits that are not so important to relative fitness. Much research has been done on the condition dependence of precopulatory traits under strong sexual selection, but not as much on postcopulatory traits. Our research focused on measuring the effect of resources on both pre- and postcopulatory traits in male mealworm beetles as well as their effect on their mates’ relative fitness. Interestingly, although we found that important life history traits such as body size and adult lifespan were condition dependent, precopulatory traits such as pheromone attractiveness and postcopulatory traits such as ejaculate transfer were not. Our study highlights the complicated nature of tradeoffs in resource allocation faced by individuals under sexual selection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Remaining in the same job or with the same employer for a long time, or even an entire career, is not viewed favorably in the dominant managerial discourse. Yet this is the reality for many employees in Europe. What are the mechanisms used by employees to assume this stability in the face of career norms that favor mobility? What is new in this research, with regard to the existing literature, is that it explains the career stability of employees in terms of identification mechanisms, in particular identification with the content of their work. Several results were obtained using the coding method to process the data collected in an association operating in the social sector. We began by distinguishing between four modalities of work content identification: normative, cognitive, emotive and performative. We went on to highlight two effects of work identification: the free will of agents, made possible by the argumentative resources they provide, and dependence on their work through the integration of structural constraints. Three types of arguments (factual, existential and normative) are identified which enable employees to adopt unique positions in relation to their career in the face of today’s mobility norms: distantiation, conciliation and conformity. The process-based model proposed contributes to a dialectical reading of careers—between structural and agentic effects—emphasizing the social mechanisms used by employees to 'cope' with pressure to embrace career mobility.

AB  - Research on power suggests asymmetric task dependence (sending work resources to a coworker and receiving little in return) should create a power imbalance and promote selfishness. In contrast, work design theory suggests asymmetry can lead to felt responsibility, but this link has not been tested and its theory remains underdeveloped. Drawing on self-determination theory (SDT), this article argues that work design characteristics can encourage the SDT internalization process—the transformation of external reasons for behavior into internal reasons. Two experiments demonstrate asymmetry encourages felt responsibility for the dependent’s task, which helps explain the amount of help provided to the dependent. The author proposes felt responsibility indicates the extent to which an external task has been internalized as a self-directed motivation. This article clarifies how task dependence is different from power and develops an important and understudied aspect of SDT: how work design characteristics are transformed into internalized motivations.

AB  - Background: Vietnam began providing methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) in 2008; as of June 2016, 44,479 persons who inject drugs (PWID) were in treatment in 57 provinces. However, 10–23% of patients were estimated to have dropped out of treatment during the first 2 years. We evaluated dropout and factors associated with quitting treatment. Methods: We followed clients ≥ 18 years old enrolled in five MMT clinics in Haiphong for 3 years. Persons who missed a consecutive month of methadone treatment were considered to have dropped out and were not allowed to return; those who missed greater than five consecutive doses were considered to be non-compliant but were allowed to restart treatment at their initial dose. Clients who dropped out or who were non-compliant during their third year of MMT (cases) were traced and matched with two clients who remained in treatment (controls) by gender, age, and length of time in the program. Cases and controls were interviewed. Additional data on levels of yearly retention were abstracted from clinic records. esults: Among the 1055 patients initially enrolled in MMT, dropout and non-compliance combined was 13.6% during the first year, 16.5% during the second year, and 22.3% during the third year. By 36 months, 33.3% of clients had dropped out, of whom 10.6% had died and 24% had been arrested. We traced and interviewed 81 clients who dropped out or who were non-compliant during year 3 as well as 161 controls. The primary reasons for dropping out included claiming no dependence on heroin (22.2%), conflict with work (21.0%), health problems (16.0%), and inability to afford the methadone co-payment of approximately 0.5 USD/day (14.8%). Independent factors associated with non-compliance included continuing to use heroin (aOR = 12.4, 95% CI 4.2–36.8) and missing greater than three doses during the previous 3 months (aOR = 18.5, 95% CI 7.4–47.1); receiving a daily dose of > 120 mg of methadone was associated with a lower odds ratio of dropping out (aOR = 0.3, 95% CI 0.1–0.9). Conclusion: By 3 years, one third of all patients in treatment had permanently dropped out. Ensuring that methadone dosing is adequate and reducing or eliminating the co-payment fee for those who cannot afford it could improve retention.

AB  - Although emerging research suggests that pain-related anxiety may play a role in the maintenance of tobacco dependence, no previous work has examined pain-related anxiety as a predictor of smoking cessation outcomes. The current study aimed to test the hypothesis that pain-related anxiety would predict early lapse and relapse to cigarette smoking. These data were collected in the context of a primary study examining the role of emotional vulnerabilities in smoking cessation. The current analyses were conducted among 55 daily cigarette smokers who attempted to quit without psychosocial or pharmacological cessation aids. Pain-related anxiety was assessed at baseline using the Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale-20 (PASS-20). Early lapse and relapse were assessed using timeline follow-back procedures. Cox regression analyses indicated that pain-related anxiety was a significant predictor of both early smoking lapse and relapse such that for every 1-point increase on the PASS-20, the risk of early lapse increased by 3.7% and the risk of early relapse increased by 3.6%. These effects were evident above and beyond the variance accounted for by tobacco dependence, past 4-week pain severity, anxiety sensitivity, and the presence of current Axis I psychopathology. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses further revealed that among early lapsers, greater pain-related anxiety predicted a more rapid trajectory to lapse. Pain-related anxiety was also a significant predictor of early lapse when the sample was limited to smokers with past 4-week pain. These findings lend empirical support to the notion that pain-related anxiety may contribute to the maintenance of tobacco dependence among smokers who experience varying levels of pain intensity.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical predictors of response to treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) in a sample of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). A total of 55 patients diagnosed as OCD according to revised 3rd edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria underwent a 12-week standardized SSRI treatment. According to 'treatment response', defined as at least a 35% drop in the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale total score, OCD patients were divided into two groups. A total of 32 (58.2%) patients who responded to treatment and 23 (41.8%) who did not, were compared in terms of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. The authors' findings demonstrated that the severity of obsession-compulsions and disability in work, social and family lives at the beginning of treatment were significantly higher in OCD patients who did not respond to treatment in comparison to those who did. Linear regression analysis, however, revealed that Sheehan Disability Scale-work score at baseline was a predictor of response to SSRI treatment. The higher levels of disability at the beginning of treatment in patients with OCD are associated with a poorer response to SSRI. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined the demographic characteristics, education, certification status, and attitudes to certification of staff who work in addictions treatment services. 925 managers, supervisors, and counselors (average age 40.7 yrs) working at addictions treatment agencies in Ontario, Canada, completed surveys. Results show that 80% of Ss possessed college certificates or university degrees, and the majority reported taking professional development courses in the previous year. However, only 20% of Ss were certified as either an addictions counselor or as another type of human service provider. Overall, 25% of Ss had completed, or were involved in, addiction certificate programs. 17% of those with university degrees had also been involved with addiction certificate programs. University education was most common among those working in assessment/referral and outpatient services. Approximately 30% of Ss in short- and long-term residential services also possessed university degrees. Those working in detoxification centers were least likely to report having a university education, and a substantial minority reported no postsecondary academic qualifications.

AB  - The Gelberg–Andersen Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations was applied to understand vulnerable Appalachian women’s (N = 400) utilization of addiction treatment. A secondary data analysis included multiple multivariate analyses. The strongest correlates of treatment utilization included ever injecting drugs (OR = 2.77), limited availability of substance abuse treatment facilities (OR = 2.03), and invalidated violence abuse claims (OR = 2.12). This study contributes theory-driven research to the greater social work addiction literature by confirming that vulnerable domains related to substance abuse treatment utilization warrant unique considerations compared to nonvulnerable domains. Findings also highlight the importance of understanding the unique role that cultural factors play in treatment utilization among Appalachian women. Inferences relevant to clinicians and policymakers are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The present study examines the interaction between a polygenic score and an elementary school-based universal preventive intervention trial and its effects on a discrete-time survival analysis of time to first smoking marijuana. Research has suggested that initiation of substances is both genetically and environmentally driven (Rhee et al., Archives of general psychiatry 60:1256–1264, 2003; Verweij et al., Addiction 105:417–430, 2010). A previous work has found a significant interaction between the polygenic score and the same elementary school-based intervention with tobacco smoking (Musci et al., in press). The polygenic score reflects the contribution of multiple genes and has been shown in prior research to be predictive of smoking cessation, tobacco use, and marijuana use (Uhl et al., Molecular Psychiatry 19:50–54, 2014). Using data from a longitudinal preventive intervention study (N = 678), we examined age of first marijuana use from sixth grade to age 18. Genetic data were collected during emerging adulthood and were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 microarray (N = 545). The polygenic score was computed using these data. Discrete-time survival analysis was employed to test for intervention main and interaction effects with the polygenic score. We found main effect of the polygenic score approaching significance, with the participants with higher polygenic scores reporting their first smoking marijuana at an age significantly later than controls (p = .050). We also found a significant intervention × polygenic score interaction effect at p = .003, with participants at the higher end of the polygenic score benefiting the most from the intervention in terms of delayed age of first use. These results suggest that genetics may play an important role in the age of first use of marijuana and that differences in genetics may account for the differential effectiveness of classroom-based interventions in delaying substance use experimentation.

AB  - There is recognition that cognitive problems can contribute to renewed drug taking in former addicts. Our previous work has indicated that current smokers show reduced performance on a probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) task, relative to former smokers. To further explore PRL performance and its relevance to smoking, in addition to the role of nicotine, we developed a model of nicotine withdrawal‐induced deficits in rodents. A second goal was to test varenicline, an α4β2 partial agonist, for its ability to restore any cognitive impairment. Acute effects of nicotine and varenicline on PRL performance in non‐dependent animals were minimal and confined to speed of responding. When rats were made dependent on nicotine via osmotic minipumps implanted for 7 days (3.16 mg/kg/day), repeated tests at specified withdrawal time points revealed PRL disruption peaking at 12 and 24 hours following surgical removal of minipumps. Withdrawal was characterized by significant deficits in the number of reversals (P < 0.05), speed of responding (P < 0.01) and increases in omissions (P < 0.05). Nicotine (0.2 mg/kg SC) or varenicline (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg SC) administered 10‐minute prior to PRL test sessions during withdrawal, relieved the performance deficits. At 24‐hour withdrawal, nicotine and varenicline (1 mg/kg) prevented decrements in reversals, in addition to ameliorating slower speed of responding. The high dose of varenicline only reduced omissions. These results confirm the role of nicotine in withdrawal‐induced disruption of PRL performance and suggest that the model may be useful for investigating efficacy of potential new treatments for smoking cessation.

AB  - Background: Athina Markou and her colleagues discovered persistent changes in adult behavior following adolescent exposure to ethanol or nicotine consistent with increased risk for developing addiction. Building on Dr. Markou’s important work and that of others in the field, researchers at the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies have found that persistent changes in behavior following adolescent stress or alcohol exposure may be linked to induction of immune signaling in brain. Aim: This study aims to illuminate the critical interrelationship of the innate immune system (e.g., toll-like receptors [TLRs], high-mobility group box 1 [HMGB1]) in the neurobiology of addiction. Method: This study reviews the relevant research regarding the relationship between the innate immune system and addiction. Conclusion: Emerging evidence indicates that TLRs in brain, particularly those on microglia, respond to endogenous innate immune agonists such as HMGB1 and microRNAs (miRNAs). Multiple TLRs, HMGB1, and miRNAs are induced in the brain by stress, alcohol, and other drugs of abuse and are increased in the postmortem human alcoholic brain. Enhanced TLR-innate immune signaling in brain leads to epigenetic modifications, alterations in synaptic plasticity, and loss of neuronal cell populations, which contribute to cognitive and emotive dysfunctions. Addiction involves progressive stages of drug binges and intoxication, withdrawal-negative affect, and ultimately compulsive drug use and abuse. Toll-like receptor signaling within cortical-limbic circuits is modified by alcohol and stress in a manner consistent with promoting progression through the stages of addiction.

AB  - Few scholars have examined psychopathology correlates of sex work. It has been suggested that sex work may reflect manifestations of impulsive-antisocial psychopathic traits (e.g., reckless disregard, delinquency) in women more than men. The current work examined relative contributions of drug dependence and distinct psychopathic features in relation to traditional forms of sex work (i.e., prostitution) in women, along with gender differences in psychopathy relationships with casual forms of sex exchange (i.e., trading sex for necessities). Study 1 included 171 community-dwelling women offenders, and Study 2 included 319 participants (42.3% women) with histories of drug use and/or violence. Participants completed the Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version, prostitution was measured as self-report and/or public record data across studies, and sex exchange in Study 2 was assessed using a questionnaire based on prior research on sexual risk-taking. Findings across both studies demonstrated that although psychopathic traits, particularly impulsive-antisocial features, were associated with prostitution in women above the use of drugs, drug dependence did not moderate the relationship between psychopathic traits and prostitution in women. Analyses of Study 2 data revealed that impulsive-antisocial traits were associated with sex exchange at low, but not high, levels of interpersonal-affective traits across participants. As well, interpersonal-affective traits were significantly positively related to sex exchange in men and not significantly (and negatively) related in women. In sum, impulsive-antisocial traits related to prostitution among women, suggesting that women may manifest these traits within intimate contexts. Moreover, findings indicated gender differences in the manifestation of interpersonal-affective traits within sexual exchange contexts. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)
AB  - General Scientific Summary—This study supports the idea that women may manifest impulsive-antisocial psychopathic traits within intimate and gendered contexts, such as sex work and exchange. Findings suggest that impulsive-antisocial features of psychopathy are associated with traditional forms of sex work over and above drug dependence in adult women, and interpersonal-affective psychopathic traits exhibit differential relationships with more casual forms of indirect sex exchange in men and women, such that they are significantly positively associated with sex exchange in men and not significantly (and negatively) related in women.

AB  - The aim was to describe the occupational transition process to upper secondary school, further education and/or work, and to discover what support influences the process from the perspectives of young adults with Asperger syndrome or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This qualitative study was performed in Sweden and comprised interviews with 15 young adults recruited from community based day centres. Support influencing the process included: occupational transition preparation in compulsory school, practical work experience in a safe environment, and support beyond the workplace. The overall understanding shows that the occupational transition process was a longitudinal one starting as early as in middle school, and continuing until the young adults obtained and were able to remain in employment or further education.

AB  - Background: Previous neuroimaging data indicated that the dysfunction in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit contributed to the neuropathological mechanism of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Whereas, emerging work has shown that the pathophysiology of OCD might be related to more widely distributed large-scale brain systems including limbic system and the salience network. This study aims to investigate the aberrant spontaneous neuronal activity within the whole brain, and its association with the symptom severity for unmedicated OCD patients. Method: Twenty-eight unmedicated OCD adults and twenty-eight matched healthy controls were recruited for a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) analysis over whole brain was performed to examine the intrinsic cerebral activity of subjects. In addition, we conducted the voxel-based Pearson’s correlative analysis to probe into the relationship between ALFF values and symptom severity for OCD patients. Results: Our results showed that OCD patients had increased ALFF measures in the left frontopolar cortex and left orbital frontal cortex (OFC), with decreased ALFF values in the right insula. Moreover, the right insular intrinsic activity was significantly correlated with total YBOCS score (r = 0.611, p = 0.002) and compulsion score (r = 0.640, p = 0.001) for OCD patients. Conclusion: The results showed abnormal intrinsic neuronal activity within CSTC circuit and salience network of OCD patients. Our finding of aberrant insular activity advanced the understanding of OCD pathophysiology beyond the traditional CSTC circuit. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first finding about a reduced insular activity at the resting state for unmedicated OCD patients, which might serve as an informative biomarker for OCD pathophysiology.

AB  - Video games have traditionally held a dubious reputation in the media and have been linked to many antisocial behaviors. A large amount of research has borne out some of these concerns, linking video games with addiction and particularly aggression. However, recent work in this area has begun to examine the positive aspects of video gaming. In this work, we examine how playing casual, low-involvement video games with an outgroup member may reduce prejudice. In Study 1, participants played cooperatively or competitively with a (trivial) outgroup member or alone. In Studies 2 and 3, a meaningful social identity was used: students’ university affiliation. Participants played either cooperatively with a rival university student against the computer, or alone. Analyses of all three studies showed that attitudes toward the outgroup were more positive after playing with an outgroup member compared with control conditions. How these findings may be applied to real world groups and extensions for future research are then discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Parenting and family support are key prevention and intervention strategies for improving outcomes for children and families affected by parental drug misuse. However, little is known about the delivery of parenting support for drug‐dependent parents, particularly within universal healthcare services. This study aimed to explore the way healthcare practitioners engage with this challenging agenda. Four multidisciplinary focus groups involving a purposive sample of 18 experienced healthcare professionals were conducted in Scotland. Participants included general practitioners, midwives, public health nurses and addiction staff who work together to provide care for vulnerable families. A focus group topic guide was developed to explore the views and experiences of these healthcare professionals in relation to providing parenting support for drug‐using parents, predominantly those receiving opioid substitution therapy. Data were analysed using a constant comparison method and thematic approach. The overarching narrative which united the focus group discussions was about the ‘burden of care’ that these families pose for frontline healthcare professionals. Recurring themes centred on three key issues: the problematic nature of drug‐using parents themselves; clinical challenges in living up to the ideals of professional practice; and the wider context in which current practice is governed. Professionals expressed ambivalence over their parenting support role; anxiety over responsibility for intervening with this ‘hard‐to‐engage’ population; and concern over ‘dwindling’ resources and lack of organisational support. Nevertheless, strategies and opportunities for providing parenting support were acknowledged and there was consensus about the need for further skills training. Despite a proliferation of policy and good practice guidance on the delivery of parenting support for drug‐dependent parents, the findings of this study suggest that significant challenges remain. Notably, our findings raise questions about whose role it is to provide parenting support to drug‐using mothers and fathers, especially those who are not involved in the child protection system.

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 16(4) of Journal of Social Work Practice in the Addictions (see record [rid]2016-52318-011[/rid]). In the original article, Kenneth E. Tharp, BA's name appeared incorrectly as 'Bakenneth E. Tharp.'] Untreated alcohol and drug addiction continues to be a major health issue in the United States. To meet the challenges of this chronic illness, treatment should be based in the best, most up-to-date science. Treatment retention and completion have been continually shown to significantly improve health and wellness outcomes. Unfortunately, most individuals who enter programs do not successfully complete them. The goal of this study is to use evidence mapping to define the best evidence-based practices and strategies to improve retention rates within addiction services and to present recommendations.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on adult substance abuse and violence in a sample of offenders (n = 180). Higher ACE scores were significantly correlated with substance abuse scores and violence scores. Substance abuse and violence were also significantly correlated with each other. The violent offenders had significantly higher ACE and substance abuse scores than the nonviolent offenders. In a hierarchical logistic regression model, the ACE score and substance score both emerged as significant predictors of violence. Better understanding of the links between early adversity and adult criminal and addictive behavior will help improve social work practice in forensic and correctional settings. Implications for trauma-informed social work practice and policy are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Higher levels of repetitive negative thinking (RNT; a perseverative and abstract focus on negative aspects of one’s experience) are associated with reduced sleep duration. This information is already informing theory and clinical practice. However, we are not aware of any studies examining the relation between RNT and the timing of sleep. We examined both disorder specific measures of RNT and a transdiagnostic measure of the RNT process in relation to sleep duration and timing in a sample of 100 unselected undergraduates. Replicating prior findings, shorter sleep duration was cross-sectionally associated with more rumination and delayed sleep timing was associated with more obsessive–compulsive symptoms. Further, extending this prior work, the transdiagnostic measure of RNT was associated with shorter sleep duration and delayed sleep timing. Individuals who endorsed a preference for later sleep and activity times also reported more RNT. These findings suggest that RNT may be uniquely related to both sleep duration and timing.

AB  - What factors shape managerial attitudes towards the utilization of work-life policies? The influence of disruptiveness (Powell and Mainiero 1999) and dependency (Klein, Berman and Dickson 2000) arguments on managerial attitudes is examined using a vignette design. In this study, managers in four financial firms in the UK and the Netherlands were asked to judge hypothetical requests from employees to utilize work-life policies. Findings indicate that managers are mainly interested in the performance of their department or work unit, and work-life policies are often seen as disruptive. However, when the least disruptive request is considered (short-term leave), we find that dependency arguments also play an important role and managers are more likely to respond to their employees’ personal and family needs.

AB  - Background: Adaptive behaviour is closely related to quality of life in children with intellectual disability (ID), but little is known about the adaptive behaviour of children with fragile X syndrome (FXS) in China. Method: In boys with FXS, the adaptive behaviours in six domains, including self‐dependence, locomotion, work skills, communication, socialisation and self‐management, were assessed by the Infants‐Junior Middle School Students Social‐life Abilities Scale. In addition, we compared the adaptive skills of boys with FXS to those of three control groups of boys, including boys with Down syndrome (DS) and typically developing (TD) boys matched by chronological age (CA) or mental age (MA). The profile of the adaptive behaviour of boys with FXS is discussed in detail. Results: Compared to boys with DS, boys with FXS obtained lower scores in three domains in adaptive behaviour, including work skills, socialisation and self‐management skills; boys with FXS had better scores in self‐dependence and locomotion skills than boys matched for MA; as expected, boys with FXS had significantly poorer adaptive skills in all six domains assessed compared to CA boys. Conclusion: The development of adaptive skills in boys with FXS was worse than that of boys with DS. The profile of the adaptive behaviour of boys with FXS establishes a basis for the development of targeted interventions to promote social development in this population.

AB  - This study falls within the framework of Mayfield and Mayfield’s proposal (2008, 2010) on creative environment perceptions. The objective was to adapt the 9-item Creative Environment Perceptions Scale into Spanish and analyse its psychometric properties. The sample for the present study was made up of 975 Spanish employees (48.5% men and 51.5% women). After carrying out a confirmatory analysis the results displayed a three factor structure: Support to creativity, Job characteristics and Blocks to creativity. Furthermore, the three factors showed appropriate reliability and some signs of validity were also found when they were contrasted with certain external correlates and scales that refer to workaholism, burnout and creative potential. By way of summing up, the present scale may prove ideal for appropriately identifying support to creativity, job characteristics and blocks to creativity.

El objetivo fue realizar la adaptación al español de la escala Creative Environment Perceptions de nueve ítems y analizar sus propiedades psicométricas. Los participantes fueron 975 empleados españoles (48.5% hombres y 51.5% mujeres). Los resultados obtenidos demuestran, después de realizar análisis confirmatorio, una estructura constituida por tres factores: Apoyo a la Creatividad, Características del Trabajo y Bloqueos a la Creatividad. Además, los tres factores obtenidos tienen una fiabilidad adecuada e igualmente se constatan indicios de validez, si se toman como referencia algunos correlatos externos y algunas escalas que hacen referencia a la adicción al trabajo, el burnout y el potencial creativo. En suma, la presente escala puede resultar idónea para identificar de manera apropiada los tres factores. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

Widiger and colleagues, however, have argued that maladaptive behavior exists at both ends of trait continua. We propose that the role of evaluative variance differentiates these two perspectives and that once evaluation is isolated, maladaptive behaviors emerge at both ends of nonevaluative trait dimensions. In Study 1, we argue that evaluative variance is worthwhile to measure separately from descriptive content because it clusters items by valence regardless of content (e.g., lazy and workaholic; apathetic and anxious; gullible and paranoid; timid and hostile, etc.), which is unlikely to describe a consistent behavioral style. We isolate evaluation statistically (Study 2) and at the time of measurement (Study 3) to show that factors unrelated to valence evidence maladaptive behavior at both ends. We argue that nonevaluative factors, which display maladaptive behavior at both ends of continua, may better approximate ways in which individuals actually behave.

AB  - We analyzed the correspondence between implicit and explicit attitudes of health care practitioners working with drug addicts as a function of years of professional experience, and its relation with important organizational outcomes. Consistent with the hypothesis that implicit–explicit attitude inconsistency is unpleasant and people struggle to resolve it, practitioners’ implicit–explicit consistency increased with years of experience. Moreover, for practitioners self-reporting positive attitudes, negative implicit attitudes led to increased absenteeism and decreased voluntary extra work. For practitioners self-reporting negative attitudes, positive automatic associations had similar effects. Strengths, limitations, and possible extensions of this research are discussed.

AB  - The widespread availability of online word of mouth (WOM) enables modern consumers to assess not only the opinions of others about products and services, but also the extent to which those opinions are consistent or dispersive. Despite longstanding calls for greater understanding of mixed opinions, existing evidence is inconclusive regarding effects of WOM dispersion, and theoretical accounts have relied primarily on the notion of reference dependence. Extending prior work, this research proposes an attribution-based account, in which consumer interpretation of WOM dispersion depends on the extent to which tastes in a product domain are perceived to be dissimilar, so that dispersion can be attributed to inconsistency in reviewer preferences rather than the product itself. Across four experimental studies, participants presented with online rating distributions were more tolerant of dispersion in taste-dissimilar product domains than taste-similar product domains, and the difference was driven by underlying attributions. Together, these findings expand current understanding of WOM, social distributions, and risk perception, by revealing distinct pathways through which consumers respond to differences of opinion. In addition, they suggest the opportunity to proactively influence the manner in which dispersion is perceived, highlighting its positive connotations while diminishing its association with risk.

AB  - An attempt has been made to study the Work motivation among entrepreneurs. 60 entrepreneurs units were selected randomly and 38 male entrepreneurs and 22 female entrepreneurs were randomly selected. Their age ranges from 28-40 years. They are first generation entrepreneurs without having inherited family business. General Information Questionnaire developed by investigator, Motivation Questionnaire (WMQ) by K.G. Agrawal (1988) were employed to collect the data. Comparison between male and female entrepreneurs on work motivation was made on the bases of t. Results shows that entrepreneurs are motivated by work worth, responsibility, recognition, freedom for planning and satisfaction with job. They also feel that variables like harassment; and less freedom to take decisions hampered their motivation to work. The dependency factor very much motivates the entrepreneurs to work, work motivation of women entrepreneurs is much higher than men entrepreneurs. On other factors of work motivations the female entrepreneurs are much higher on dependence, organizational orientation, work group relation, intrinsic motivation, and material incentives.

AB  - Recently, an addiction matrix measure was assessed among U.S. former alternative high school youth. This presentation seeks to examine the generalizability of findings using this measure among Russian and Spanish high school adolescents. Latent class analysis was used to explore addiction subgroups among adolescents in Russia (average age = 16.27; n = 715) and Spain (average age = 14.9; n = 811). Last 30-day prevalence of one or more of 11 addictions reviewed in the previous work was the primary focus (i.e., cigarettes, alcohol, hard drugs, eating, gambling, Internet, love, sex, exercise, work, and shopping) among Russian youth, and last-30 prevalence of one or more of 8 addictions among Spanish youth (the three drug use items had not been included in the questionnaire for these youths). Results confirmed a two-class model (addicted class and non-addicted class) among both Russian and Spanish adolescents. The mean number of addictions reported was 1.39 (SD = 1.78) addictions among Russian youth and 1.56 (SD = 1.68) addictions among Spanish youth. The prevalence of the sample that constituted the 'addicted group' in Russia and Spain was 32.2% and 28.6%, respectively. The most prevalent addictions (i.e., love, Internet, exercise) were similar. These results are similar to the findings previously reported for U.S. sample. Latent class structures for addictive behaviors are similar across international adolescent populations. Our results highlight the need to address multiple addictions in health education programming. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aim: To identify indicators that diverse stakeholders believe are important when measuring recovery from addiction. Methods: Our previous work with service users had generated 28 indicators of recovery. Using Delphi group methodology (three rounds), we assessed the extent to which stakeholders working in the addictions field agreed that the 28 indicators were important on a scale of 1–10. Participants included 146 individuals with diverse job roles in 124 organisations across the British Isles. Findings: Round 1 scores were high. There was evidence of greater scoring consensus in Round 2, but this trend was less certain in Round 3. Participants scored 27/28 indicators ≥ 7/10 in Round 3, so confirming their importance. The only Round 3 indicator with a mean score < 7 was 'experiencing cravings'. There were statistical differences between the Round 3 indicator scores of some sub-groups of participants, but absolute differences were small (never more than 1 point for any indicator). Conclusions: We have identified 27 recovery indicators that stakeholders working within the addiction field in the British Isles consistently ranked as important. Replicating our methods in other countries, and with additional stakeholder groups, will provide greater clarity on the term 'recovery', its relevance and value, and how it can best be measured.

AB  - Extant work on the relationship between obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and suicide is scarce. Moreover no research has examined potential moderators that may increase risk for suicide among those with OCD. The current study examined the moderating role of anxiety sensitivity (AS) cognitive concerns. The cognitive concerns subscale of AS, which reflects fears of cognitive dyscontrol, has been found to be associated with the obsessions dimension of OCD and increased suicidality in a number of populations. The sample included 80 patients (3.8 % with a primary OCD diagnosis) recruited from the community to participate in a larger clinical trial investigating the effects of an AS intervention on suicide. Results indicated the obsessive dimension of OCD was associated with increased suicidality. Additionally, AS cognitive concerns moderated the relationship between these variables. Future research should examine the relationships between these constructs prospectively. Results of this investigation highlight the importance of assessing suicidal risk as part of a comprehensive OCD assessment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Gambling disorder has recently been recognized as a prototype ‘behavioral addiction’ by virtue of its inclusion in the DSM-5 category of ‘Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders.’ Despite its newly acquired status and prevalence rate of 1–3 % globally, relatively little is known regarding the neurobiology of this disorder. The aim of this study was to explore cortical morphometry in untreated gambling disorder, for the first time. Subjects with gambling disorder (N = 16) free from current psychotropic medication or psychiatric comorbidities, and healthy controls (N = 17), were entered into the study and undertook magnetic resonance imaging (3T MRI). Cortical thickness was quantified using automated segmentation techniques (FreeSurfer), and group differences were identified using permutation cluster analysis, with stringent correction for multiple comparisons. Gambling disorder was associated with significant reductions (average 15.8–19.9 %) in cortical thickness, versus controls, predominantly in right frontal cortical regions. Pronounced right frontal morphometric brain abnormalities occur in gambling disorder, supporting neurobiological overlap with substance disorders and its recent reclassification as a behavioral addiction. Future work should explore the trait versus state nature of the findings and whether similarities exist with other not-yet-reclassified putative behavioral addictions.

AB  - Nicotine is the addictive substance in tobacco and it has a broad impact on both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Over the past decades, an increasing number of genes potentially involved in nicotine addiction have been identified by different technical approaches. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying nicotine addiction remain largely unclear. Under such situation, a comprehensive analysis focusing on the overall functional characteristics of these genes, as well as how they interact with each other will provide us valuable information to understand nicotine addiction. In this study, we presented a systematic analysis on nicotine addiction-related genes to identify the major underlying biological themes. Functional analysis revealed that biological processes and biochemical pathways related to neurodevelopment, immune system and metabolism were significantly enriched in the nicotine addiction-related genes. By extracting the nicotine addiction- specific subnetwork, a number of novel genes associated with addiction were identified. Moreover, we constructed a schematic molecular network for nicotine addiction via integrating the pathways and network, providing an intuitional view to understand the development of nicotine addiction. Pathway and network analysis indicated that the biological processes related to nicotine addiction were complex. Results from our work may have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying nicotine addiction. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: This study follows the theoretical framework put forward by Hinton on creative potential and practised creativity. The objective was to adapt the 17-item Creative Potential and Practised Creativity scale into Spanish and examine its psychometric properties. Method: The study sample was made up of 975 Spanish employees (48.5% men and 51.5% women). Results: After performing a confirmatory factor analysis, the findings revealed a three-factor structure: Creative potential, Practised creativity and Perception of organizational support. Furthermore, appropriate reliability was found for all three factors as well as initial evidence of construct validity in relation to certain external correlates and a series of scales measuring workaholism, irritation, burnout and personality. Conclusions: The present scale may prove ideal for adequately identifying Creative potential, Practised creativity and Perceived organizational support.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine female sex workers' solicitation of clients using mobile phones and the association between this and condom use with clients. Cross-sectional data were utilised to address the study's aim, drawing on data collected from female sex workers in Calicut, Kerala, and Chirala, Andhra Pradesh. Use of mobile phone solicitation was reported by 46.3% (n = 255) of Kerala participants and 78.7% (n = 464) of those in Andhra Pradesh. Kerala participants reporting exclusive solicitation using mobile phones demonstrated 1.67 times higher odds (95% CI: 1.01–2.79) of inconsistent condom use than those reporting non-use of mobile phones for solicitation. However, those reporting exclusive solicitation through mobile phones in Andhra Pradesh reported lower odds of inconsistent condom use (OR: 0.03; 95% CI: 0.01–0.26) than those not using mobile phones for solicitation. Findings indicate that solicitation of clients using mobile phones facilitates or hampers consistency in condom use with clients depending on the context, and how mobile phones are incorporated into solicitation practices. Variations in sex work environments, including economic dependence on sex work or lack thereof may partially account for the different effects found.

AB  - We gave 220 individuals (88 male, M age = 29.32 years) the Self-Perceptions of Text Messaging Dependency Scale (SPTMDS, which measures emotion reaction, excessive use, disruption of relationships with text messages and psychological/behavioral symptoms concerning heavy usage) and an iPod Dependence version of the SPTMDS. Little work has examined how iPod usage is associated with individuals, despite iPod ubiquity with other electronic devices. All four of the subscales of the SPTMDS were significantly and positively correlated with the four subscales of the iPod dependence scale. Similarly, all four iPod dependence subscales correlated positively with a measure of depression, state anxiety, and trait anxiety. Age was negatively correlated with iPod and texting dependence. Staying connected to the social world appears to have important consequences for adequate mental health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In recent years there has been growing recognition of the role of trauma in substance abuse treatment; however, only 20% of outpatient treatment programs report offering trauma services. We conducted a secondary analysis of the 2012 National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) and explore how demographic, population served, and organization variables distinguish those programs that offer trauma services from those that do not. In this article, we present the findings, which revealed that organizational structure, process, and population served variables were the most important predictors of trauma services. Implications for social work practice in the addictions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: There is a lack of empirical studies of patients’ level of humiliation during the hospital admission process and its implications for the clinical setting. We wanted to explore associations between self-rated humiliation and socio-demography and psychopathology in relation to admission to a psychiatric emergency unit. Methods: Consecutively admitted patients (N = 186) were interviewed with several validated instruments. The patients self-rated humiliation by The Cantril Ladder, and 35% of the sample was defined as the high humiliation group. Results: Final multivariate analysis found significant associations between compulsory admission, not being in paid work, high scores on hostility, and on entitlement, and high levels of humiliation. No significant interactions were observed between these variables, and the narcissism score was not a confounder concerning humiliation. Conclusions: High level of humiliation during the admission process was mainly related to patient factors, but also to compulsory admission which should be avoided as much as possible protecting the self-esteem of the patients.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the influence of user, staff and work unit characteristics on addiction care practitioners’ assessments of the severity of alcohol and drug use. A factorial survey was conducted among 489 social workers, therapists, nurses, doctors and executives from 77 addiction care units in the three largest Swedish counties. Staff assessed the severity of 10 fictive scenarios, vignettes (n = 4724), describing persons with varying social characteristics who were users of alcohol, cannabis or cocaine. The effects of user, respondent and work-unit variables on the practitioners’ severity assessments were estimated using multilevel regression analysis. The results show that perceived severity was influenced not only by the substance, the frequency and character of the negative consequences of the use, but also by the age, socio-economic status and family situation of the user. Women, older respondents and respondents with a medical education rather than a social work education were on average more inclined to assess the vignettes as being more severe. Analyses of various interactions revealed that practitioners viewed the drinking of young men as being less severe than that of young women. Doctors saw women's use as more problematic than men's, irrespective of the context. To conclude, alcohol and drug consumption is judged by different norms, depending on various characteristics of the users, of the practitioners and also of their workplaces. To avoid potential negative consequences of the application of such varying standards in addiction care, more individual reflection and workgroup discussion are needed.

AB  - Across sectional study where 145 hairdressers were interviewed for the occurrence of work related upper limb disorders (WRULD). The interview features for engagement, burnout and workaholism, as well as asks for general health and working conditions. The BMI, the hand size and gripping force of each worker was obtained. WRULD was present in 41%. It was significantly correlated with burnout and workaholism. Surprisingly it was not altered by engagement or by the use of ergonomic equipment. Morphological features (BMI), hand size and gripping force, were not related to the occurrence of WRULD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article examines how the amount of judicial personnel work hours available for each juvenile dependency case in a county may be related to the percentage of cases reaching key decision hearings in a timely manner. Panel analyses of data from Washington State indicate that, when controlling for community risk factors, counties with more judicial personnel per case held timely fact‐finding and permanency planning hearings more often and more often achieved timely adoptions. Judicial personnel per case, however, was not a significant predictor of the percentage of permanent placements completed within timeliness goals.

AB  - Work intensification can be an organisational tool to increase the productivity of an existing workforce. We investigate employee reactions to three levels of sustained extensive work intensification (long work hours over two consecutive time periods) of the two most prevalent generational groups in the labour market: Generation X and Baby Boomers. Boomers have been characterised as ‘workaholics’ who ‘live to work’, while Gen Xers are ‘slackers’ who ‘work to live’. We investigate, using a nationally representative sample of employees, whether these generational differences in work attitudes impact employee reactions (measured by employee reports of job satisfaction and work–life balance) to sustained extensive work intensification. The results show that perceptions of job satisfaction and work–life balance are reduced by sustained extensive work intensification but the differences between the two generations are minimal, suggesting that organisations do not need to tailor their employment practices to fit the work values of different generations.

AB  - Since occupational health psychology is a relatively young specialty, it would be informative to gauge the extent of research emphasis on key topical areas in the sub-discipline. This study reports on a content analysis of journal articles (1996-2012) in the leading APA journal in the area: Journal of Occupational Health Psychology. The most researched topics were: Work-Family factors, strain-stress models,physical health, workplace health promotion, burnout, and well-being. The analysis identified a host of important areas within the domain of occupational health (e.g., person-job fit, workaholism, ergonomics, hazardous materials, discrimination, legal issues) that received sparse research interest. These findings a) support the Pareto effect-where the majority of research reflects a limited range of topics, and b) prompt the issue of whether research adequately informs practice.

AB  - The notion of voluntary unemployment held by orthodox economic theory could be refuted by happiness research, showing that those unemployed experience a persistent loss in life-satisfaction. However, most current research addressing this question is conducted at the individual level or takes into account only simple economic aggregate indicators, such as unemployment rates or inflation. The effects of unemployment on life satisfaction however are likely to vary between societies depending on factors beyond the economic realm. This paper demonstrates the need to consider a wider set of country-level characteristics, including economic, demographic and attitudinal indicators, if the relationship between unemployment and life-satisfaction is to be understood adequately. Using data from the World Values Survey multi-level models are computed for up to 40 European and Anglo-Saxon societies. While economic indicators such as GDP per capita and income inequality appear to be relevant, unemployment rates seem to not affect the relationship greatly, contrary to results from several previous studies. Other factors however do, either mitigating the loss in life-satisfaction when becoming unemployed (such as the mean level of the perception of autonomy in a society), or further depressing life satisfaction (such as the mean emphasis of work in a society, the age-dependency ratio or the proportion of women in the labour force). Possible explanations are discussed and suggestions for improved further research made. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Several studies have identified discrete symptom dimensions in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), derived from factor analyses of the individual items or symptom categories of the Yale–Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale Symptom Checklist (YBOCS-SC). This study aims to extend previous work on the relationship between obsessions and compulsions by specifically including mental compulsions and reassurance-seeking. Because these compulsions have traditionally been omitted from prior factor analytic studies, their association to what have been called ‘‘pure obsessions’’ may have been overlooked. Method: Participants (N = 201) were recruited from two multi-site randomized clinical treatment trials for OCD. The YBOCS-SC was used to assess OCD symptoms, as it includes a comprehensive list of obsessions and compulsions, arranged by content category. Each category was given a score based on whether symptoms were present and if the symptom was a primary target of clinical concern, and a factor analysis was conducted. Mental compulsions and reassurance-seeking were considered separate categories for the analysis. Results: Using an orthogonal geomin rotation of 16 YBOCS-SC categories/items, we found a five-factor solution that explained 67% of the total variance. Inspection of items that composed each factor suggests five familiar constructs, with mental compulsions and reassurance-seeking included with sexual, aggressive, and religious obsessions (unacceptable/taboo thoughts). Conclusions: This study suggests that the concept of the ‘‘pure obsessional’’ (e.g., patients with unacceptable/taboo thoughts yet no compulsions) may be a misnomer, as these obsessions were factorially associated with mental compulsions and reassurance-seeking in these samples. These findings may have implications for DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Service user and carer involvement in social work education is now well established since its inception as a compulsory requirement in the social work curriculum in the United Kingdom in 2003. Since then, there have been many examples of how such involvement has been approached by education providers. Nevertheless, one of the key obstacles and challenges in this field continues to centre on the need to achieve non-tokenistic user involvement which cements the engagement of service users and carers at the heart of social work education. This paper describes one such initiative where service user and carer colleagues in a university in Northern Ireland have been actively involved in the assessment of first year social work students’ preparation for their first period of practice learning. The paper presents the background to this initiative explaining how the project unfolded; the detailed preparations that were involved and the evidence gathered from evaluations undertaken with the students, service users and carers, and academic colleagues who were all involved. We believe that the findings from this project can contribute to the advancement of existing knowledge in the field in exploring and recommending creative methodologies for user involvement in social work education.

AB  - The authors examined the contributions of infant's temperament and parent's personality to their relationship. In Study 1, 102 infants, mothers, and fathers were studied when infants were 7 months; in Study 2, 112 infants and mothers were followed from 9 to 45 months. Infants' temperament (joy, fear, anger, and attention) was observed in standard temperament paradigms. Parents' personality measures encompassed the Big Five traits and Empathy in Study 1 and Mistrust, Manipulativeness, Aggression, Dependency, Entitlement, and Workaholism in Study 2. Parent-child relationship (shared positive affect and parental responsiveness in Studies 1 and 2 and parental tracking of the infant in Study 1) was observed in naturalistic contexts. In Study 1, mothers' Neuroticism, Empathy, and Conscientiousness and fathers' Agreeableness, Openness, and Extraversion related to the relationship with the infants. All measures of infant temperament also related to the emerging relationship. In Study 2, maternal Mistrust, Manipulativeness, Dependency, and Workaholism predicted the relationship with the child.

AB  - This study aims to examine whether the relationship between overtime and well-being is influenced by the voluntary vs. involuntary (i.e., compulsory) nature of overtime work and by the presence or absence of rewards for overtime. We also explored the prevalence of these types of overtime and how they were related to work and personal characteristics. A survey was conducted among a representative sample of Dutch full-time employees (N = 1612). AN(C)OVA was used to compare rewarded and unrewarded, voluntary and involuntary overtime workers on personal and work characteristics, fatigue, and work satisfaction. Most overtime workers were rewarded (62%). About half of the sample (n = 814) could be classified as either voluntary or involuntary overtime workers, or as having 'mixed reasons' to work overtime. Voluntary and unrewarded overtime workers had a relatively high income and favourable job characteristics. Involuntary overtime work was associated with relatively high fatigue and low satisfaction, especially for involuntary overtime workers without rewards who can be considered a burnout risk group. Voluntary overtime workers were non-fatigued and satisfied, even without rewards. It can be concluded that control over overtime and rewards for overtime are important for well-being. Moderate overtime work may not be a problem if it is done voluntarily. Moreover, the negative effects of compulsory overtime work may be partly offset by fair compensation for the extra work.

AB  - Technical advances allowing for the analysis of functional MRI (fMRI) results in real time have led to studies exploring the ability of individuals to use neural feedback signals to modify behavior and regional brain activation. The use of real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) feedback has been explored for therapeutic benefit in a number of disease states, but to our knowledge, the potential therapeutic benefit of rtfMRI feedback in the treatment of addictive disorders has not been explored. This article will provide an overview of the development of rtfMRI and discussion of its potential uses in the treatment of addictions. We also describe a series of pilot studies that highlight some of the technical challenges in developing a rtfMRI feedback paradigm for use in addictions, specifically in nicotine dependence. Because the use of rtfMRI feedback is in its infancy, the work described is focused on establishing some of the basic parameters in optimizing the rtfMRI feedback, such as the type of feedback signal, region of interest for feedback and predicting which subjects are most likely to respond well to training. While rtfMRI feedback remains an intriguing possibility for the treatment of addictions, much work remains to be done in establishing its efficacy.

AB  - Person-fit assessment is used to identify persons who respond aberrantly to a test or questionnaire. In this study, S. P. Reise's (2000) method for evaluating person fit using 2-level logistic regression was applied to 13 personality scales of the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality (SNAP; L. Clark, 1996) that had been administered to military recruits (N = 2,026). Results revealed significant person-fit heterogeneity and indicated that for 5 SNAP scales (Disinhibition, Entitlement, Exhibitionism, Negative Temperament, and Workaholism), the scale was more discriminating for some people than for others. Possible causes of aberrant responding were explored with several covariates. On all 5 scales, severe pathology emerged as a key influence on responses, and there was evidence of differential test functioning with respect to gender, ethnicity, or both. Other potential sources of aberrancy were carelessness, haphazard responding, or uncooperativeness. Social desirability was not as influential as expected.

AB  - Rationale: Stimuli associated with nicotine can become motivationally significant and may play a role in tobacco dependence. Previous work indicates that nicotine enhances responding for a conditioned reinforcer (CR). Objectives: These studies examined the effects of prior exposure to nicotine on responding for a CR, persistence of this response, and the role of α4β2 or α7 nicotinic receptor subtypes. Methods: Water deprived rats were given 13 Pavlovian conditioning sessions where a light/tone conditioned stimulus (CS) was paired with the delivery of water. Then, rats were presented with two levers: one delivered the CS (now a CR), the other was inactive. Experiments examined the effect of nicotine administered prior to Pavlovian conditioning sessions on approach behavior during CS presentations, operant responding for CR in the presence and absence of nicotine, and the persistence of responding for CR. The effects of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonism with mecamylamine and α4β2 or α7 nAChR antagonism with dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DHβE) or methyllycaconitine (MLA) on nicotine-enhanced responding for CR were examined. Results: Nicotine enhanced approach behavior during CS presentations and potentiated operant responding for CR, an effect sensitized as a result of nicotine exposure during conditioning. Responding for CR and its potentiation by nicotine was stable over multiple tests. Enhanced responding for the CR induced by nicotine was blocked by mecamylamine and DHβE, but not MLA. Conclusions: Nicotine enhances Pavlovian discriminated approach and shows sensitized nicotine-induced enhancements in responding for CR, an effect depending on α4β2 nAChRs.

AB  - The current study investigated the role of lifestyle as a significant factor related to the aggression and violence between cohabitating partners. Based on previous research, lifestyle was defined as a special reflection of socialization into society and working life, where different lifestyles should also be able to produce different patterns of socialization into people's roles as partners. It was found that gender and years of cohabitating were significantly related to Emotional aggression and Sexual violence; lifestyle patterns were associated with specific forms of violence. More specifically, the lifestyles of Pleasure & Elegance and the one of Culture-Intellectualism were found to promote Emotional aggression. Also, the lifestyle of Yuppies/Workaholic and that of Physical activities stimulated the appearance of Sexual violence between partners. Moreover, individuals with Tradition-Religiousness lifestyle were more likely to show lower levels of Physical & Sexual violence while the adherents of the Substance abuse lifestyle pattern appeared to have an inclination towards Physical & Sexual violence. Finally, the occurrence of one form of violent behaviour was likely to be related to the other forms of violent behaviour. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Expectancies for drug effects predict drug initiation, use, cessation, and relapse, and may play a causal role in drug effects (i.e., placebo effects). Surprisingly little is known about expectancies for caffeine even though it is the most widely used psychoactive drug in the world. In a series of independent studies, the nature and scope of caffeine expectancies among caffeine consumers and nonconsumers were assessed, and a comprehensive and psychometrically sound Caffeine Expectancy Questionnaire (CaffEQ) was developed. After 2 preliminary studies, the CaffEQ was administered to 1,046 individuals from the general population along with other measures of interest (e.g., caffeine use history, anxiety). Exploratory factor analysis of the CaffEQ yielded a 7-factor solution. Subsequently, an independent sample of 665 individuals completed the CaffEQ and other measures, and a subset (n = 440) completed the CaffEQ again approximately 2 weeks later. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed good model fit, and test–retest reliability was very good. The frequency and quantity of caffeine use were associated with greater expectancies for withdrawal/dependence, energy/work enhancement, appetite suppression, social/mood enhancement, and physical performance enhancement and lower expectancies for anxiety/negative physical effects and sleep disturbance. Caffeine expectancies predicted various caffeine- associated features of substance dependence (e.g., use despite harm, withdrawal incidence and severity, perceived difficulty stopping use, tolerance). Expectancies for caffeine consumed via coffee were stronger than for caffeine consumed via soft drinks or tea. The CaffEQ should facilitate the advancement of our knowledge of caffeine and drug use in general. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Although there is considerable research demonstrating the prospective association between earlier maladaptive personal attributes and later nicotine dependence, there is less work on the psychosocial mediators of this relationship. Maladaptive personal attributes appear in the form of depression, anxiety, and interpersonal sensitivity. This study was designed to assess the prospective relationship between earlier maladaptive personal attributes (mean age = 40) and later nicotine dependence (X age=65.2) within an understudied female community sample. The participants were given self-administered questionnaires. The results supported a model by which earlier maladaptive personal attributes predicted later nicotine dependence through several indirect pathways. In addition to cigarette smoking, several domains mediated the relation of earlier maladaptive personal attributes and later nicotine dependence. These domains included internal factors (ie, later maladaptive personal attributes), interpersonal factors (ie, marital/partner conflict), later contextual factors (ie, family financial difficulty). Our multidimensional longitudinal findings have important implications for the prevention and treatment of nicotine dependence. The results identify earlier and later significant psychosocial risk factors to be targeted, and suggest the timing of interventions to reduce or eliminate nicotine dependence.

AB  - Background: Substitution with opioid-agonists (e.g., methadone) has shown to be an effective treatment for chronic long-term opioid dependency. Survival sex work, very common among injection drug users, has been associated with poor Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) engagement, retention and response. Therefore, this study was undertaken to determine factors associated with engaging in sex work among long-term opioid dependent women receiving OAT. Methods: Data from a randomized controlled trial, the North American Opiate Medication Initiative (NAOMI), conducted in Vancouver and Montreal (Canada) between 2005-2008, was analyzed. The NAOMI study compared the effectiveness of oral methadone to injectable diacetylmorphine or injectable hydromorphone, the last two on a double blind basis, over 12 months. A research team, independent of the clinic services, obtained outcome evaluations at baseline and follow-up (3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months). Results: A total 53.6% of women reported engaging in sex work in at least one of the research visits. At treatment initiation, women who were younger and had fewer years of education were more likely to be engaged in sex work. The multivariate logistic generalized estimating equation regression analysis determined that psychological symptoms, and high illicit heroin and cocaine use correlated with women’s involvement in sex work during the study period. Conclusions: After entering OAT, women using injection drugs and engaging in sex work represent a particularly vulnerable group showing poorer psychological health and a higher use of heroin and cocaine compared to women not engaging in sex work. These factors must be taken into consideration in the planning and provision of OAT in order to improve treatment outcomes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Definitions of workaholism convey the notion of singular commitment to work to the detriment of extra-work activities. This study examines the relationship of workaholism type, work involvement, drive, and work enjoyment to measures of extra-work satisfaction (family, friends, community). Data were collected from 530 women and men managers and professionals using anonymous questionnaires. Results showed the hypothesized negative relationship between workaholism and extra-work satisfactions. Implications for reducing workaholic behaviors are offered.

AB  - Our study aims to assess the prevalence of behavioural addictions in an adolescent population, evaluating the effects of gender and age, and to assess the correlations among different behavioural addictions. 2853 high school students were assessed in order to evaluate the prevalence of behavioural addictions such as Pathological Gambling (PG), Compulsive Buying (CB), Exercise Addiction (EA), Internet Addiction (IA), and Work Addiction (WA), in a population of Italian adolescents. The South Oaks Gambling Screen-Revised Adolescent (SOGS-RA), the Compulsive Buying Scale (CBS), the Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI), the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), and the Work Addiction Risk Test (WART), were compiled anonymously by the students. Overall prevalence was 7.0% for PG, 11.3% for CB, 1.2% for IA, 7.6% for WA, 8.5% for EA. PG and EA were more common among boys, while gender had no effect on the other conditions. CB was more common among younger (<18 years old) students. The scores of all of these scales were significantly correlated. The strong correlation among different addictive behaviours is in line with the hypothesis of a common psychopathological dimension underlying these phenomena. Further studies are needed to assess personality traits and other clinical disorders associated with these problems behaviours. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The project Can I Do It? was based on the formation of a new methodology to work with people who are addicted to methamphetamine. In developing of this methodology, authors work with the Foundation 66 in London, which has been treating people for substance abuse. This methodology deals with brief intervention programs for methamphetamine addiction treatment. The method consists of 12 steps. Topics that are discussed with the client are based on the mapping of client problems and direct the client to abstinence. The principle method of work with clients is based on cognitive behavioral therapy. The benefits of this lies in its application especially in outpatient work with people addicted to methamphetamine.

AB  - Experiences of stigma from others among people with a history of drug addiction are understudied in comparison to the strength of stigma associated with drug addiction. Work that has studied these experiences has primarily focused on stigma experienced from healthcare workers specifically even though stigma is often experienced from other sources as well. Because stigma has important implications for the mental health and recovery efforts of people in treatment, it is critical to better understand these experiences of stigma. Therefore, we characterize drug addiction stigma from multiple sources using qualitative methodology to advance understandings of how drug addiction stigma is experienced among methadone maintenance therapy patients and from whom. Results demonstrate that methadone maintenance therapy patients experience prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination from friends and family, coworkers and employers, healthcare workers, and others. Discussion highlights similarities and differences in stigma experienced from these sources. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: Early onset of heroin use during adolescence might increase chances of later drug addiction. Prior work from our laboratory suggests, however, that adolescent male rats are actually less sensitive than adults to some enduring effects of heroin self-administration. In the present study, we tested two likely correlates of sensitivity to behavioral reinforcement in rats: physical withdrawal and locomotor sensitization. Methods: Adolescent (35 days old at start) and adult (79 days old) male Sprague–Dawley rats were administered escalating doses of heroin, increasing from 1.0 to 8.0 mg/kg (i.p.) every 12 h, across 13 days. Somatic signs of spontaneous withdrawal were scored 12 and 24 h after the last injection, and then every 24 h for 5 days; locomotion was recorded concurrently. Challenge injections of heroin (1 mg/kgi.p.) were given at four points: as the first of the escalating doses (day 1), at days 7 and 13 during the escalating regimen, and after 12 days of forced abstinence. Body mass and food intake were measured throughout experimentation. Results: A heroin withdrawal syndrome was not observed among adolescents as it was among adults, including somatic signs as well as reduced locomotion, body mass, and food intake. On the other hand, heroin-induced locomotor sensitization did not differ across ages. Conclusion: Reduced withdrawal is consistent with the attenuated reinforcing effects of heroin among adolescent male rats that we reported previously. Thus, it is possible that adolescent rats could reveal important neuroprotective factors for use in treatment of heroin dependence. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We examined the content and dimensional structure of a large and representative sample of gender types. In Study 1, using an open-ended procedure, participants generated 306 different labels for female types (e.g. housewife, feminist, femme fatale, secretary, slob) and 310 for male types (e.g. workaholic, family man, sissy, womanizer, labourer). In Study 2A, a multidimensional configuration of 229 of these male and female types was derived from a free sorting task among a new set of participants. In Study 2B, a subset of types was judged on several dimensions of meaning, which were then fitted into the configuration of types. The most important dimensions in describing the structure of gender types were: young-old, masculine-feminine and traditional-modern. The masculine-feminine dimension showed that the male and female types were largely separated from each other; within each gender category, the types were ordered by their position on the masculine-feminine dimension. Several other aspects of current thinking about men and women are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Associations between hours worked per week and Body Mass Index (BMI), food intake, physical activity, and perceptions of eating healthy at work were examined in a sample of transit workers. Methods: Survey data were collected from 1086 transit workers. Participants reported hours worked per week, food choices, leisure-time physical activity and perceptions of the work environment with regard to healthy eating. Height and weight were measured for each participant. Multivariate linear and logistic regressions were conducted to examine associations between work hours and behavioral variables. Associations were examined in the full sample and stratified by gender. Results: Transit workers working in the highest work hour categories had higher BMI and poorer dietary habits, with results differing by gender. Working 50 or more hours per week was associated with higher BMI among men but not women. Additionally, working 50 or more hours per week was significantly associated with higher frequency of accessing cold beverage, cold food, and snack vending machines among men. Working 40 or more hours per week was associated with higher frequency of accessing cold food vending machines among women. Reported frequency of fruit and vegetable intake was highest among women working 50 or more hours per week. Intake of sweets, sugar sweetened beverages, and fast food did not vary with work hours in men or women. Physical activity and perception of ease of eating healthy at work were not associated with work hours in men or women. Conclusions: Long work hours were associated with more frequent use of garage vending machines and higher BMI in transit workers, with associations found primarily among men. Long work hours may increase dependence upon food availability at the worksite, which highlights the importance of availability of healthy food choices.

AB  - Although studies have found associations between maternal distress/anxiety and alterations in blood flow, data across different trimesters are inconsistent. We, therefore, sought to determine the association between measures of distress and uterine blood flow in all three trimesters. Healthy women with low-risk singleton pregnancies were recruited from antenatal clinics. Women were assessed at 13–14 weeks (T1), 21–22 weeks (T2), and 32–33 weeks (T3) of gestation with measures of distress and anxiety (the K10, Perceived Stress Scale, and the State Subscale of the Spielberger State–Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI]) and with uterine Doppler flow velocity studies. The Trait Subscale of the STAI was done either at T1 or T2. Thirty women were seen at T1, 79 women were seen at T2, and 59 women were seen at T3. No significant correlations were found between measures of distress and anxiety and umbilical artery pulsatility index (PI) or middle cerebral artery PI at any time-point. Small positive correlations between trait anxiety and uterine artery PI were found, but these were not significant after adjustment for alcohol and nicotine use (any use as well as problem drinking/nicotine dependence). At T3 but not T1 or T2, women scoring above 20 on the K10 (a standardized cutoff for the presence of axis I psychiatric disorders) had higher uterine artery PI than those scoring below 20. This was significant after adjusting for alcohol and nicotine use, as well as when nicotine dependence was considered. This work highlights the complexities of the relationship between increased measures of distress and anxiety and changes in the placental circulation. Further work in this area is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms which account for this relationship and to delineate fully the extent to which the relationship is determined by the presence of psychiatric and substance use disorders.

AB  - Chilean community psychology has undergone an evolution that has positioned it as a reference in the institutional practices of psychosocial intervention. This has involved the standardization of interventions, resulting in the abandonment of some of the founding precepts of the discipline, in a context lacking ethical indications for the field. As a way of outlining the current disciplinary practices and their ethical implications, social representations of professional practice between clients of Government and NGO social programs were investigated, through the realization of 4 participatory interviews with 32 clients. Discourse analysis tools were used. The results show a strong appreciation of the relationship between client and professional, a progressive strengthening from individual work, professional dependence, and a series of correct and incorrect actions as perceived by the client.

AB  - Background: Drug addiction and alcoholism involve a complex etiopathogenesis with a variable degree of risk contributions from the host (person), environment, and addictive substances. In this work, temperament and character features of individuals addicted to opiates or alcohol are compared with normal controls to study personality factors in the overall risk for drug addiction. Methods: The study was done in a permissive environment, with easy access to alcohol and heroin, which facilitated analyses of personality factors in drug choice. Participants included 412 consecutive patients (312 opiate addicts, 100 alcohol addicts) treated at the Specialized Hospital for Chemical Dependency in Belgrade, Serbia, and a community sample of 346 controls. Results: Opiate addicts manifested antisocial temperament configuration (high Novelty Seeking, low Reward Dependence) coupled with high Self-transcendence (ie, susceptibility to fantasy and imagination). Alcohol addicts manifested sensitive temperament configuration (high Novelty Seeking coexisting with high Harm Avoidance). Immature personality was observed far more frequently in opiate addicts than in alcoholics or normals. Conclusions: Novelty Seeking appears to be a general risk factor for drug addiction. High Harm Avoidance appears to channel individuals with high Novelty Seeking towards alcoholism. Immature character traits and probable Personality Disorder increase the risk of illegal drugs. Based on equivalent research in nonpermissive environments, at least a portion of our opiate addicts could have developed alcoholism instead in environments with more limited access to opiates. Personality factors provide useful guidelines for preventive work with young individuals with personality risk factors for drug addiction.

AB  - The intensive entertainment infrastructure of Las Vegas is overlaid with a robust therapeutic network for those who become addicted to its technologies. Although the objectives of gambling machines and addiction therapeutics are seemingly at odds--the first work to encourage play, the second to stop it--both gear their interventions around a model of the self as a continuum of behavioral potentials that can be externally modulated. For compulsive gamblers implicated in this circuit of modulation, pharmaceutical drugs that have been prescribed to dampen cravings for machine play sometimes function as intensifiers of its effects. Caught in an intractable play between technologies of harm and technologies of care, recovering gambling addicts are challenged to assemble a technical array through which they can maintain balance; health itself, for these individuals, becomes a state of managed dependency. This essay explores the shifting terms and changing stakes of subjectivity and health in the contemporary United States by way of ethnographic research on compulsive gamblers who live and work in Las Vegas. The analysis draws on interviews with gamblers as well as on observations in local self-help groups, directed group therapy sessions, and chat rooms of Internet recovery Web sites.

AB  - Personality disorders were examined in 157 incarcerated women (aged 21-61 yrs) using the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality to assess 10 %DSM-III-R% diagnostic categories and dimensions and 15 domains of trait/temperament relevant to disordered personality. An exploratory analysis examined whether the older Ss differed from their younger incarcerated cohorts on underlying trait and temperament scales. Similar to both community samples and incarcerated men, older Ss had lower rates of personality disorders than younger Ss, and the difference was mostly accounted for by differences in the Cluster B disorders. In an exploratory analysis of trait and temperament scales, the older Ss also scored lower in Aggression, Disinhibition, Entitlement, Exhibitionism, Impulsivity, and Manipulativeness while younger Ss scored lower in Workaholism and Propriety. These findings suggest that remission of antisocial behavior in women may be associated with changes in lower order personality traits or temperament.

AB  - Musculoskeletal diagnoses account for the majority of cases of reduced work capacity. This article investigates lay persons' (aged 35-47 yrs old) strategies in relation to work and musculoskeletal disorders. Twenty interviews were conducted and analysed using grounded theory. A typology of self-presentations was developed. The interviewees' self-presentations revealed a strong sense of a 'duty to work'. This sense of duty took four different forms, leading us to categorise persons expressing particular forms as workaholics, work manics, workhorses or relaxed workers. Relaxed workers seem to have the best prognosis for recovery as they had a confident self-agency and worked to fulfill their own needs rather than those of others. This was in contrast to work manics, with an uncertain self-agency and driven to work by others' needs. In conclusion, awareness of such linguistic forms as self-attributions and idiomatic phrases provides an opportunity to identify and talk about individual's self-agency and driving forces in the recovery process.

AB  - Context: Due to the chronic nature of cocaine dependence, long-term maintenance treatments may be required to sustain abstinence. Abstinence reinforcement is among the most effective means of initiating cocaine abstinence. Practical and effective means of maintaining abstinence reinforcement programs over time are needed. Objective: To determine whether employment-based abstinence reinforcement can be an effective long-term maintenance intervention for cocaine dependence. Design: Participants (n = 128) were enrolled in a 6-month job skills training and abstinence initiation program. Participants who initiated abstinence, attended regularly and developed needed job skills during the first 6 months were hired as operators in a data entry business and assigned randomly to an employment-only (control, n = 24) or abstinence-contingent employment (n = 27) group. Setting: A non-profit data entry business. Participants Unemployed welfare recipients who used cocaine persistently while enrolled in methadone treatment in Baltimore. Intervention: Abstinence-contingent employment participants received 1 year of employment-based contingency management, in which access to employment was contingent upon provision of drug-free urine samples under routine and then random drug testing. If a participant provided drug-positive urine or failed to provide a mandatory sample, then that participant received a temporary reduction in pay and could not work until urinalysis confirmed recent abstinence. Main outcome measure: Cocaine-negative urine samples at monthly assessments across 1 year of employment. Results: During the 1 year of employment, abstinence-contingent employment participants provided significantly more cocaine-negative urine samples than employment-only participants [79.3% and 50.7%, respectively; P = 0.004, odds ratio (OR) = 3.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.60-8.69]. Conclusions: Employment-based abstinence reinforcement that includes random drug testing is effective as a long-term maintenance intervention, and is among the most promising treatments for drug dependence. Work-places could serve as therapeutic agents in the treatment of drug dependence by arranging long-term employment-based contingency management programs.

AB  - The mesolimbic dopamine system plays an important role in mediating a variety of behaviors and is involved in mediating the reinforcing effects of ethanol. Genes encoding dopamine receptor subtypes are thus good candidate loci for understanding the genetic etiologies of susceptibility to alcohol dependence and its antecedent behavioral phenotypes. We tested whether variation in DRD1 influences alcohol consumption in rhesus macaques and whether its influence is mediated by sex and early rearing experience. We genotyped a single nucleotide polymorphism (−111 G/T) in the 5'UTR of DRD1 in 96 subjects raised with their mothers until 6 months of age (n = 43) or in peer-only groups (n = 53). As young adults they underwent a 7-week voluntary ethanol consumption experiment. ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of sex (F1,95=6.3, P=0.014) and an interaction between genotype, sex and rearing on ethanol consumption (F7,95=4.63, P=0.0002). Maternally deprived males heterozygous for the T allele consumed significantly more ethanol (P >t ≤0.0001) than the other subgroups. Maternal deprivation can produce individuals that are anxious and impulsive, both of which are known risk factors for alcohol dependence. Our work demonstrates a potential role for the dopamine D1 receptor gene in modulating alcohol consumption, especially in the context of early environmental stress.

AB  - N‐acetylcysteine (NAC) has been suggested to have therapeutic potential in the treatment of drug addiction through its effects on brain glutamate homeostasis. Here we show that NAC treatment resulted in dose‐dependent reductions in cocaine seeking at both early and late stages of acquisition and maintenance of cocaine‐seeking behavior, while confirming it had no effect on cocaine reinforcement. The results indicate that NAC is able to significantly diminish the propensity to seek cocaine early and late in the development of addiction and, taken together with previous work, indicates significant potential in relapse prevention.

AB  - Rationale: Nicotine withdrawal is characterized by depression- like symptomatology that may be mediated by dysregulations in norepinephrine transmission. These aversive aspects of nicotine withdrawal and the rewarding effects of nicotine play major roles in maintaining nicotine dependence. Objectives: The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of desipramine (DMI), a preferential norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and antidepressant, on preclinical models of nicotine dependence in rats. Materials and methods: A rate-independent current-intensity discrete-trial threshold intracranial self-stimulation procedure was used to assess brain reward function during nicotine withdrawal induced by cessation of nicotine infusion via subcutaneous osmotic mini pumps (3.16 mg/kg/day, base). Nicotine withdrawal was also measured by somatic signs of withdrawal. DMI was administered acutely (2 or 5 mg/kg, salt) during nicotine/saline withdrawal. In other naïve rats, chronic DMI treatment via mini pump (15 mg/kg/day, salt) began after 7 days of nicotine/saline exposure and continued during administration of nicotine/saline for 14 days and during nicotine/saline withdrawal. Additional rats acquired intravenous nicotine- or food-maintained responding, were prepared with DMI/vehicle-containing mini pumps, and selfadministered nicotine or food during 12 days of DMI/vehicle exposure. Results: Acute DMI administration had no effect on threshold elevations observed in nicotine-withdrawing rats. Chronic DMI administration prevented the reward threshold elevations and the increased somatic signs of nicotine withdrawal. Although chronic DMI significantly decreased nicotine self-administration, it also decreased food-maintained responding. Conclusions: The results suggest that norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors may be effective anti-smoking treatments that reduce the anhedonic depression-like and somatic components of nicotine withdrawal and may alter the rewarding effects of nicotine and food.

AB  - Rationale: Adolescent smoking is an increasing epidemic in the US. Research has shown that the commencement of smoking at a young age increases addiction and decreases the probability of successful cessation; however, limited work has focused on nicotine dependence in the female. Objective: The goal of the present study was to identify the biological and behavioral factors that may contribute to nicotine's increased abuse liability in female adolescents using animal models of nicotine dependence. Materials and Methods: Early adolescent (PND 28) and adult (PND 70) female mice were compared in various aspects of nicotine dependence using reward and withdrawal models following sub-chronic nicotine exposure. Furthermore, in vivo acute sensitivity and tolerance to nicotine were examined. Results: In the conditioned place preference model, adolescents demonstrated a significant preference at 0.5 mg/kg nicotine, an inactive dose in adults. Adults found higher doses (0.7 and 1.0 mg/kg) of nicotine to elicit rewarding effects. Furthermore, adolescents displayed increased physical, but not affective, withdrawal signs in three models. Upon acute exposure to nicotine, adolescent mice showed increased sensitivity in an analgesic measure as well as hypothermia. After chronic nicotine exposure, both adults and adolescents displayed tolerance to nicotine with adolescents having a lower degree of tolerance to changes in body temperature. Conclusions: These data indicate that differences in nicotine's rewarding and aversive effects may contribute to variations in certain components of nicotine dependence between adult and adolescent female mice. Furthermore, this implies that smoking cessation therapies may not be equally effective across all ages. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The existing expatriation literature concentrates on what individuals need to perform in an international assignment (IA) but neglects what they gain from their foreign work experience. Using a dual-dependency perspective this study presents results from 26 in-depth interviews with international secondees within two UK-based organizational contexts. The paper explores the perceived impact of an IA on the career capital of individuals, showing that the outcomes of IAs can be equivocal for expatriates. Each firm concentrated their human resource mechanisms on developing different types of career capital and this focused individual behaviour on diverse career capital activities. In one of the organizations there was an internal misalignment between organizational and individual assignee focus. Based on the research a number of propositions were developed. This study provided an exploratory insight into points of departure rather than complementarity in individuals' international careers in organizations, which has been at the core of much recent research and writing. A more complex, contextualized picture of the effects of IAs on the careers of individuals emerged. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article explores the motives of individuals to accept international assignments. It uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to further our understanding of how important a variety of items are in the decision to work abroad. Employing a mutual dependency perspective it contrasts individual motives and organizational perspectives. Organizations significantly underestimate the importance of career, work/life balance and development considerations and overestimate the financial imperative and some family motives. The analysis showed that for individuals some of these factors significantly relate to outcome variables in terms of the perceived career capital accrued from assignments. The study presents a more nuanced picture of influence factors on the decision to go and advocates the use of context-sensitive, multiple perspectives. Practical implications for multinational organizations are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article intends to show, first, how feminist interpretations of women's needs in the context of workfare are formed through social interactions within community groups. Second, we demonstrate that these interactions are happening within a context of a public policy that is reshaping volunteer work and volunteer time within the community sector by requiring that women living on welfare transform their volunteer work into compulsory work and by asking community groups to accept workfare placements, which result in the displacement of volunteer workers and transform the meaning of volunteer work itself. The article ends with a discussion on the intermediary status of women's groups, as well as the evolution of women's needs representation within the public/political sphere.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between substance abuse and dependence and violent behavior in a sample of incarcerated women with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). Among male populations, substance dependence is associated with aggression and criminal behavior. Individuals with ASPD have more severe substance dependence, including higher symptom counts, earlier age of onset, and more frequent co-morbidity. Incarcerated women have a high prevalence of ASPD and substance dependence, but there has been little detailed work regarding addiction severity. Similarly, work on association of substance abuse and dependence with specific violent behaviors has been limited. This study examined a group of 41 mid-sentence female felons with a diagnosis of ASPD to determine associations with substance abuse and dependence. Data were gathered through administration of the Semi-Structured Assessment of the Genetics of Alcoholism II (SSAGA II). Substance dependence was highly prevalent (i.e., alcohol dependence, 56.1%; opiate dependence, 48.8%; cocaine dependence, 61.0%). While specific diagnoses were not associated with violent behavior and offending, symptom severity (i.e., age of onset, symptom count, co-morbidity) was associated with violent behavior in women dependent on opiates, alcohol, and cocaine. Arrest for an assault 1 was associated with alcohol dependence and opiate dependence. These data suggest that measurement of symptom severity and co-morbidity is important in assessing violent behavior in incarcerated women with ASPD. These findings are potentially important in examining non-incarcerated, substance-dependent women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This cross-sectional, secondary analysis study utilizes data from a prior study of intergenerational substance use among Latina women (n = 316). We explored the influence of substance use frequency and type, as well as cultural and socioeconomic factors on attributions about addiction among a predominantly immigrant sample of Latina women. Women who were less proficient in English (an indicator of adoption of the receiving culture in the acculturation process) and more proficient in Spanish (an indicator of heritage-culture retention) endorsed more spiritual model attributions than women who were more proficient in English and less proficient in Spanish. Women who were more proficient in Spanish more frequently endorsed the disease attribution model. Alcohol, marijuana use, and nonmedical sedative use were linked with spiritual, moral character, and disease attribution models, respectively. Participants reporting higher education levels indicated less agreement with the moral/character model of addiction. Implications for culturally tailored social work interventions for Latina women are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The aim of this research was to analyze the Secondary School Managers' response to the availability of a physical and psychological space at school to work on drug addiction prevention. A semi-structured questionnaire was applied to a sample of 15 high school managers in the Argentinean Education System (public and private schools) in Buenos Aires city and in the Province of Buenos Aires. A qualitative survey was carried out within the theoretical framework of International Health Regulations, School Management, Social Psychology and formal school regulations. These managers assume that the prevention of drug addiction should be addressed at school, with the support of ether institutions and experts. The main objective should be to promote professional training in health, psychology and group dynamics and to create a warm environment at school, based en empathy, understanding and tolerance to strengthen the bond with the students.

AB  - Background: Indonesia is one of the largest consumers of tobacco in the world, however there has been little work done on the economics addiction of tobacco. This study provides an empirical test of a rational addiction (henceforth RA) hypothesis of cigarette demand in Indonesia. Methods: Four estimators (OLS, 2SLS, GMM, and System-GMM) were explored to test the RA hypothesis. The author adopted several diagnostics tests to select the best estimator to overcome econometric problems faced in presence of the past and future cigarette consumption (suspected endogenous variables). A short-run and long-run price elasticities of cigarettes demand was then calculated. The model was applied to individuals pooled data derived from three-waves a panel of the Indonesian Family Life Survey spanning the period 1993-2000. Results: The past cigarette consumption coefficients turned out to be a positive with a p-value < 1%, implying that cigarettes indeed an addictive goods. The rational addiction hypothesis was rejected in favour of myopic ones. The short-run cigarette price elasticity for male and female was estimated to be -0.38 and -0.57, respectively, and the long-run one was -0.4 and -3.85, respectively. Conclusions: Health policymakers should redesign current public health campaign against cigarette smoking in the country. Given the demand for cigarettes to be more prices sensitive for the long run (and female) than the short run (and male), an increase in the price of cigarettes could lead to a significant fall in cigarette consumption in the long run rather than as a constant source of government revenue.

AB  - This study compared personal and health factors and job characteristics in persons with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and a healthy control group and examined factors related to job characteristics. Fifteen women with SLE and 15 healthy controls completed a questionnaire regarding current employment, employer restrictions, job environment, type of work, and health factors interfering with work. Personal factors such as demographic information, disease severity, cognition, and degree of brain injury were also assessed. t-tests showed that persons with SLE worked significantly less than healthy controls but there were no significant differences between the groups for types of job or employee restrictions. In the group with SLE, health factors of mobility, dependence, musculoskeletal problems, neurological problems, and fatigue correlated with perceived social (r = 0.53 to 0.67) and physical (r = 0.56 to 0.87) work environments. None of the measures of cognition, brain injury or disease severity correlated with job characteristics. In the healthy controls, dependence at work correlated with physical environment and fatigue correlated with the social environment of the workplace. The results indicate that even persons with SLE who have mild disease are significantly different from healthy controls and might be at risk for discontinuing working.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to help persons in the helping professions recognize the serious threats to self, family life, and work experienced by persons with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and social phobia and help engage persons affected in focused, clinically responsible treatment. The article will present findings from epidemiological studies of the disorders presenting conjointly, illustrate comorbidity in clinical practice through case examples, and review clinically relevant information to be gleaned in the diagnostic assessment. Core triage decisions in initiating treatment will be reviewed. Medication approaches and patient concerns regarding medication will be overviewed. The article will summarize psycho-educational information regarding cognitive errors in OCD and social phobia that may be presented to the patient to help the patient limit anxiety-evocative and depressive thought. The author will provide illustrations of cognitive behavioral treatment in individual and group psychotherapy, transfer of training, treatment resistance, and adjunctive treatments, resources for consumers and practitioners, and emerging challenges in the field.

AB  - To examine the influence of top managers’ characteristics on the adoption of buprenorphine for opioid dependence among U.S. outpatient substance abuse treatment units, this investigation analyzed a cross-sectional national study of 547 such units in the 2004–2005 wave of the Drug Abuse Treatment System Survey. Administrators reported their demographics, training, and treatment orientation, as well as features of the unit and its pattern of use of buprenorphine. Nationally, 15.8% of programs offered any buprenorphine services. Greater adoption of buprenorphine correlated with directors’ younger age, longer tenure, male gender, and weaker endorsement of abstinence as the most important treatment goal. Availability of naltrexone and medical services also correlated positively with buprenorphine adoption. The authors conclude that leaders’ characteristics are related to the adoption of innovative practices in addiction treatment programs. Future work should examine whether leadership development for community addiction programs might speed up the diffusion of buprenorphine and other innovative, evidence-based practices.

AB  - Most previous studies concerning the associations between work and mental ill-health have used dimensional self-report questionnaires for mental health problems (e.g., depressive symptoms). This study contributes to occupational health research by providing standardized clinical diagnoses based on DSM-IV criteria. A total of 2329 employees (age 18-65 years) took part in a structured, computer-assisted clinical interview (DIA-X/M-CIDI). Further, they specified whether their job was characterized by physical workload, overtime, or stress, and evaluated whether they feel impaired by each job characteristic. Results show that substance abuse/dependence (including nicotine dependence) was the highest prevalent mental disorder in German employees (12 month prevalence: 14.4%; only alcohol and illicit substance abuse/dependence: 4.9%) followed by anxiety (12.0%) somatoform (9.7%), and affective (9.3%) disorders. Sequential logistic regression analyses showed significant associations between the presence of stress at work and affective and somatoform disorders. Furthermore, feeling impaired by stress at work was strongly associated with anxiety, affective, somatoform disorders, and substance abuse/dependence. Beside work, personal characteristics, primarily gender, were associated with mental disorders in employees. However, except for affective disorders, gender did not modify the association between job characteristics and mental disorders. Taken together, results corroborate the necessity of considering mental disorders at work. Further studies to define the relation between work and mental disorders in employees are strongly recommended and should include objective analyses of job characteristics.

AB  - Pregnancy and the early years of the child's life offer an opportune time to prevent a host of adverse maternal, child, and family outcomes that are important in their own right, but that also reflect biological, behavioral, and social substrates in the child and family that affect family formation and future life trajectories. This article summarizes a 27-year program of research that has attempted to improve early maternal and child health and future life options with prenatal and infancy home visiting by nurses. The program is designed for low-income mothers who have had no previous live births. The home-visiting nurses have three major goals: to improve the outcomes of pregnancy by helping women improve their prenatal health, to improve the child's health and development by helping parents provide more sensitive and competent care of the child, and to improve parental life course by helping parents plan future pregnancies, complete their education, and find work. The program has been tested in three separate large-scale, randomized controlled trials with different populations living in different contexts. Results from these trials indicate that the program has been successful in achieving two of its most important goals: (a) the improvement of parental care of the child as reflected in fewer injuries and ingestions that may be associated with child abuse and neglect and better infant emotional and language development; and (b) the improvement of maternal life course, reflected in fewer subsequent pregnancies, greater work-force participation, and reduced dependence on public assistance and food stamps. The impact on pregnancy outcomes is equivocal. In the first trial, the program also produced long-term effects on the number of arrests, convictions, emergent substance use, and promiscuous sexual activity of 15-year-old children whose nurse-visited mothers were low-income and unmarried when they registered in the study during pregnancy. In general, the impact of the program was greater on those segments of the population at greater risk for the particular outcome domain under examination. Since 1996, the program has been offered for public investment outside of research contexts. Careful attention has been given to ensuring that organizational and community contexts are favorable for development of the program, to providing excellent training and guidance to the nurses in their use of the program's visit-by-visit guidelines, to monitoring the functioning of the program with a comprehensive clinical information system, and to improving the performance of the programs over time with continuous improvement strategies.

AB  - Cigarette smoking is prevalent among alcoholics and illicit substance abusers. However, the potentially confounding effect of nicotine on studies of cognition in detoxified substance users has rarely been addressed. In the current study of 87 participants, behavioral and electrophysiological indices of cognitive efficiency were measured in tobacco smokers from four groups: alcoholics, illicit stimulant abusers, concurrent abusers, and control subjects. Data were collected from 2001 to 2003. We hypothesized that acute nicotine administration would modify cognitive deficits in alcoholics and illicit stimulant abusing groups. An adaptation of the Rapid Visual Information Processing task was administered after stabilization of nicotine levels via a high- or low-dose transdermal nicotine patch. Across groups, increased nicotine dose was associated with decreased reaction time (p = .03). A group × nicotine dose interaction trend was noted in which increased nicotine was associated with increased correct responding within the alcoholic group (p = .02). No significant differences in electrophysiology were observed. These results suggest that nicotine may modify cognitive efficiency in alcoholics and illicit stimulant abusers, a concept with relevance to both the design of experimental work and the treatment of alcohol and illicit stimulant dependence. Further work is needed to determine whether this effect predominantly reflects facilitation of cognition function or alleviation of nicotine withdrawal.

AB  - Thirty-one children (aged 41-98 mo) were administered a structured interview that assessed their beliefs about magic, tricks and wishes. Children were also presented with demonstrations of magic tricks/illusions, and asked to offer explanations as to how they worked. Parents completed the Childhood Routines Inventory, a 19-item parent report measure that assesses children's rituals, habits and sensory-perceptual experiences that the authors termed 'compulsive-like' behavior. Results indicated that children's rituals and compulsions were positively related to their magical beliefs, and inversely related to their uses of concrete, physical explanations to describe various phenomena. In particular, children's beliefs about the effects of wishing were most consistently correlated with their compulsive-like rituals and routines. The findings extended the work on magical beliefs and obsessive-compulsive phenomena to the normative manifestation of compulsive behaviors found in typical development.

AB  - This article presents an in-depth study illuminating how experiences of addiction and accompanying feelings, thoughts and expressions appear to the participant in the context of her life. It focuses on the participant’s engagement with alcohol as an experience of flux and instability and how it impacts on her sense of self. The study reports data from semi-structured interviews with a female participant, analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). The results are considered in relation to relevant literature, including research on addiction and recovery, works on self and identity and theory and use of metaphor. It is suggested that IPA provides an opportunity to build up a rich picture of subjective-felt experience, and thus to contribute to existing psychological research a subjective perspective not often addressed in psychological accounts of addictive behavior.

AB  - Research on the temporal distribution of criminal behavior has highlighted two distinct mechanisms--population heterogeneity and state dependence. Most of this work indicates that long-term patterns of criminal offending reflect a mixture of stable individual differences and the causal effect of life events and experiences. Yet several ambiguities remain. Among the most important of these problems is whether both population heterogeneity and state dependence processes operate for different types of offending. We use longitudinal official record and self-report data for violent and non-violent offending activity from the Rochester Youth Development Study to address these ambiguities.

AB  - This exploratory investigation sought to understand the relationship between sexual compulsivity and HIV sexual risk behaviors among gay/bisexual male escorts in New York City. Potential participants were identified through magazine advertisements, user profiles on a popular online service, and escort web sites and were sent an e-mail inviting them to call a project number for more information. 50 men (aged 22-47 yrs) completed a face-to-face interview and quantitative instruments, which assessed HIV sexual risk behaviors with work and nonwork partners, sexual compulsivity, sexual sensation seeking, and a measure of self-confidence. Sexual compulsivity was associated with higher frequency of engaging in HIV sexual risk behaviors. Lower self-confidence and higher sexual sensation seeking were found to be associated with sexual compulsivity, accounting for 36% of the total variance. This study is one of the few quantitative examinations of HIV sexual risk behaviors among gay/bisexual sex workers who are escorts, and the first to examine escorts who rely on the Internet for advertising purposes. Implications and suggestions for future research and prevention programs are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Our aim is to describe the current situation regarding the diagnosis and treatment of addiction in a variety of settings in Spain. Four-hundred and twenty-seven physicians known to treat addicted patients in non-private settings were recruited and agreed to participate. Each physician provided clinical and anonymous information on the first 6 consecutive patients who attended on a scheduled day. A total of 2361 patients were interviewed (92.1%) and data were obtained concerning gender, age, work, educational level, civil status, addiction diagnosis, type of treatment and psychiatric comorbidity. Seven-hundred and ninety-eight out of 2361 addicts (33.8%) presented with a dual diagnosis. Depression was the most prevalent disorder (21.6%), followed by anxiety disorders (11.7%). Comorbidity was found to be related to age, female gender, divorce and widowhood, and higher educational levels. Alcoholics who abused other drugs showed the highest rates of comorbidity (48.5%), while opiate addicts were at the lower end of the spectrum (27.4%). No differences were found related to the treatment setting, the doctor's medical specialty, or the geographical area. Finally, doctors tended to perceive that dual diagnosis was related to a worse psychiatric prognosis but not to higher relapse rates. Antidepressants were the most commonly prescribed drugs (62.4% of comorbid patients) and anticraving agents were prescribed equally to comorbid and non-comorbid patients. Within the limitations of a descriptive study, our data show that comorbidity is a common clinical problem in patients who access addiction treatment. Affective and anxiety disorders are the most common comorbid diseases, and comorbidity rates seem to be unrelated to regional differences, medical settings or doctor's professional background. Dual diagnosis patients thus account for one third of the clinical workload of addiction specialists in Spain. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examines the effect of recent changes in managed care penetration and financing arrangements on practice across physician types. Data are from a national survey of active physicians in the US fielded between August 1998 and November 1999. 566 psychiatrists, 7,217 primary care physicians, and 4,521 other medical or surgical specialists completed the survey. Psychiatrists are significantly less likely than primary care physicians or other specialists to agree with the statements that clinical decisions in the interest of their patients do not reduce income. Further, in comparison to primary care physicians, psychiatrists are less likely to agree that it is possible to maintain continuing relationships with patients over time that promote the delivery of high quality care and that they have the freedom to make clinical decisions that meet their patients' needs. Psychiatrists tend to work in practices with a lower dependence on managed care than either other specialists or primary care physicians. Psychiatrists are less likely than other physicians to have their income adjusted based on individual productivity. Psychiatrists are more concerned that managed care has a negative impact on patient-provider relationships; however, psychiatrists are less dependent on managed care.

AB  - The Therapeutic Workplace is an employment-based treatment for drug addiction that uses wages for work to reinforce drug abstinence. The Therapeutic Workplace has promoted abstinence from heroin and cocaine in treatment-resistant mothers in methadone treatment. This study attempted to replicate that effect in crack cocaine users recruited from community-based methadone programs. Participants were randomly assigned to a Therapeutic Workplace (n=22) or usual care control (n=25) group. Therapeutic Workplace participants were invited to work in the workplace and earn vouchers every weekday for 9 months contingent on documented opiate and cocaine abstinence. The two groups did not differ significantly on measures of cocaine or opiate use collected during study participation. Daily attendance and urinalysis results of the Therapeutic Workplace group were analyzed, and only 7 of the 22 participants initiated consistent periods of abstinence and workplace attendance. Two individuals gained access to the workplace on a few days, and 9 participants attempted to gain access to the workplace but never provided a drug-negative urine sample. Possible reasons for differences between the current study and the previous Therapeutic Workplace study are considered. Procedures that increase participant contact with the Therapeutic Workplace and its reinforcement contingencies might increase the likelihood of these individuals being successful in the treatment program.

AB  - This study identified the preliminary curriculum components for the preparation of graduate-level addiction counselors. A review of the related literature revealed no agreed upon standards for post baccalaureate instruction of addiction counseling. The Delphi method was used to establish curriculum items from a list of 198 previously identified work behaviors associated with graduate-level addiction counseling. A panel of 28 addiction counseling experts responded to three administrations of an evolving questionnaire and reached consensus on a final list of 89 curriculum items. Consensus of expert judgments was corroborated by a post hoc multivariate of analysis of variance (MANOVA) that revealed no significant differences in ratings of importance among panelist subgroups.

AB  - Social workers often need a larger range of assessment scales to be used in education, research, and practice. The Higher Power Relationship Scale (HPRS) is a new brief instrument designed for easy administration and scoring that may be of use to social work educators, researchers, and practitioners, particularly those who work in the field of addictions. This paper describes the HPRS; provides information about its administration, scoring, and interpretation; and describes the initial research conducted to validate the scale. The results clearly indicate that the scale (1) has good reliability, (2) is strong enough in terms of its measurement error traits to recommend it for use in educational, research, and clinical settings, and (3) appears to be acceptable in terms of its content and construct validity. Preliminary use in chemically dependent settings illustrated the value of the scale in understanding respondents' relationships with a higher power and Alcoholics Anonymous affiliation.

AB  - Compared street sex workers' working patterns, sexual behavior, drug use, and knowledge of HIV and Hepatitis C, in 1999 (114 women; aged 16–46 yrs) to those in 1989 (63 women; aged 18–47 yrs) among women who used a Drop-in Centre (DIC) for female sex workers in Glasgow's 'red light district'. It was found that the vast majority of prostitutes in both cohorts were drug users, although a significantly greater proportion of women in 1999 used drugs than in 1989. While the proportion of drug users who inject has remained constant, the proportion 'ever' sharing injecting equipment fell. Although condom use for commercial sex was the norm, women were not using condoms for sex with regular partners. In 1999, almost half of the women had been subject to violent assault and almost 40% to sexual assault while working. The authors contend that consideration should be given to the introduction of a methadone service for prostitutes in the city with a view to reducing their demand for illicit drugs. It is argued that if their demand for illicit drugs were reduced as a result of such a methadone programme, so too might the amount of time they required to work to fund their drug dependence, which would in turn reduce their vulnerability to violence and assault.

AB  - Reviewed evidence for the hypothesis that cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for alcohol dependence works through increasing mediating variables of cognitive and behavioral coping skills. 10 studies were identified that examined the hypothesized mechanisms of action of CBT as part of overall evaluations of CBT and drinking-related outcomes. These studies involved random assignment of Ss to CBT and at least 1 comparison condition. Results showed that, although numerous analyses of the possible causal links have been conducted to evaluate whether CBT works through increasing coping, the results indicate little support for the hypothesized mechanisms of action of CBT. It is concluded that research has not yet established why CBT is an effective treatment for alcohol dependence. Negative findings may reflect methodological flaws of prior studies. Alternatively, findings may indicate that the conceptual assumptions underlying CBT require revision. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined the relationship between alcohol use and 3 types of alcohol-related problems: International Classification of Diseases -10 dependence syndrome, work problems and drunk driving. Risk curves were developed for average number of drinks per day during the last year (volume) and number of days drinking 5 or more drinks during 1 day. Using data from the 1988 National Health Interview Alcohol Supplement, risk curves were derived from data on 22,102 current drinkers (aged 18–46+ yrs) who consumed at least 12 drinks in the last year. Results indicate that even at lower levels of drinking (volume averaging 1 or fewer drinks/day) there is considerable risk for drunk driving and less risk for work problems and alcohol dependence. The risk for all types of problems at lower and moderate levels of drinking was significantly higher for Ss who had 5 or more drinks during 1 day in the last year. Findings underscore the importance of examining risk at lower levels of drinking and for using both overall volume and heavier quantity per occasion drinking measures when assessing risk for any alcohol-related problem.

AB  - Examined the influence attitudes toward dependence have on the ability of a channel member to work effectively under conditions where dependence exists based on dependency theory, transactional cost analysis, and congruency theory. Data were obtained from 324 office systems and furniture dealers via questionnaires measuring bilateral interdependence, desire for autonomy, control relinquished, and satisfaction with suppliers. Results indicate that when dependence exists, adverse attitudes toward dependence moderate the relationships between dependence and dealer satisfaction, and dependence and revenue generated from the relationship, but not necessarily in a negative fashion or under all dependent conditions.

AB  - Examined the effects of a number of background characteristics such as early welfare dependency, substance abuse, teen parenthood, and parent's educational attainment on the family income levels of young adults who were impoverished as youth. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth database of 14–17 yr olds in poor families in 1979, the total effect of background variables on future well-being was analyzed and the paths through which this impact occurred were considered. This sample was interviewed annually from 1979–1990. Results show that many of these background variables had significant indirect influences on family income through intervening variables, especially the respondent's own educational attainment, welfare dependency, and work experiences. A model of intergenerational income level is presented. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - While a considerable amount of research has been carried out on the factors that contribute to relapse in recovering drug addicts, relatively little work has been done on the strategies which these individuals may adopt in order to prevent this happening. Based on a set of semistructured interviews with 70 recovering addicts (aged 20.2–45.3 yrs), this paper describes the ways in which these individuals sought to avoid becoming re-addicted. The 2 main strategies which they adopted were (1) the avoidance of their former drug-using network and friends and (2) the development of a set of non-drug-related activities and relationships. These strategies are described in detail, and the factors that facilitate or impede their chances of success are examined. The implications of the findings for policy and practice in relation to recovering addicts are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The majority of those addicted to virtual sex who presented for outpatient and inpatient treatment usually have more pervasive sexual or other behavioral and/or chemical addictions. Case studies of two 38-yr-old men are presented to illustrate typical patients. Treatment recommendations are made for both outpatient and inpatient treatment. Beck Hopelessness Scale test results show a significant improvement in those treated with inpatient modalities. As in treating other sex addictions, imposing limits and enlisting the aid of others works for some cybersex addicts, while others need a period of complete abstinence or to eliminate computer use entirely.

AB  - Examined whether smokers outside buildings with work-place smoking bans smoke 'harder' than those smoking in social settings. An unobtrusive random observational study of smokers followed by structured interview was used, with 143 smokers taking smoking breaks outside their office buildings and 113 smokers in social settings. The main outcome measurements were number of puffs per cigarette and cigarette smoking duration. The mean number of puffs per cigarette for the office building group (OFB Ss) was 18.7% greater than that for the social settings group (SST Ss); 74.8% OFB Ss took more than the mean number of puffs for the group compared to 42.5% of SST Ss. Mean cigarette smoking duration was 30.4% shorter for the OFB Ss than for the SST Ss. Of OFB Ss, 55.2% had a cigarette smoking duration between 3–4.59 min, while 53.1% of SST Ss took less than 5 min to smoke the observed cigarette. Regardless of degree of nicotine dependency, smokers leaving work-stations to smoke outside buildings smoked their cigarettes nearly 19% 'harder' than cigarettes smoked in social settings. The individual and public health benefits of reduced smoking frequency engendered by work-place smoking bans may be lessened by policies which allow smokers to take smoking breaks.

AB  - The applicability and clinical utility of the dependence syndrome, originally derived from work with alcoholics, across a wider range of substances was examined as part of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) field trials (L. B. Cottler; see record [rid]1993-41720-001[/rid]). When using a criterion count method to assess severity, Ss clustered at different severity levels according to the drug on which they were dependent. Across all drug classes, severity correlated reasonably well with measures of quantity and frequency of use and with associated problems. Severity of dependence related fairly well to measures of drug consumption. Findings are generally consistent with the concept of abuse liability.

AB  - Marlatt's focus on the relapse situation has had a major impact upon research and clinical practice in treating addictions. One component of his work was the development of a taxonomy for classifying precipitants of relapse. This taxonomy has been incorporated into the nomenclature of clinicians and clinical researchers as part of an explanatory framework for understanding relapses. Despite the taxonomy's influence it has never been examined for the reliability of its use across research studies. The present study compared the reliability of independent classifications of 149 relapse episodes by trained raters at three research laboratories. Despite considerable across-laboratory training, reliability was found to be inconsistent for research purposes. It is concluded that comparability of results based on Mariatt's relapse taxonomy across independent studies must be subject to question, and assumptions necessary for the aggregation of a knowledge base are not supported. Recommendations are offered for improving the reliability of the taxonomy and the methods used to collect taxonomy data. More generally, questions regarding the value of the specific relapse categories, as well as the overall taxonomy, are raised. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The responses of 8 ex-smokers to an experimental cue exposure trial, and the effect of caffeine on these responses, were compared with those of a matched group of 8 controls in a placebo controlled single-blind cross-over design. In contrast to placebo, caffeine protected the ex-smokers from a surge of anxiety and rise in blood pressure associated with exposure to smoking-related cues. Caffeine had no significant effects on the control group at this dose (equivalent to a single cup of strong coffee). The results are discussed with reference to J. Stewart's conditioned appetitive motivational model of addiction. It is suggested that further work may identify caffeine as an adjunct to smoking relapse prevention measures.

AB  - Although social workers regularly encounter clients with substance use problems, social work education rarely addresses addictions with any depth. This pilot study explored the use of screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) with 74 social work students. Students completed SBIRT training with pre- and post-questionnaires that assessed attitudes, knowledge, and skills concerning substance misuse. Statistically significant differences were demonstrated with students reporting more confidence in their ability to successfully assess for alcohol misuse and subsequently intervene.

AB  - Investigated the kind of care 72 addicts wanted when they became ill with HIV due to iv drug abuse. On a questionnaire, Ss ranked professional competence among the staff in pain treatment highest followed by competence in somatic medical care. Lower ranked, but still perceived as important, was competence in psychiatric medical care and social welfare work. Experience in treatment of addiction was ranked as less important.

AB  - Evaluated the influence of continuing education on child welfare workers' attitudes about alcoholism and other drug addictions. Study participants were 42 child welfare workers who attended a training program on the impact of addiction on child welfare practice. 37 Ss participated in a follow-up. The training appeared to foster important positive attitude changes among the Ss. At the conclusion of the training, Ss were more willing to work with their clients' addiction problems, and had more confidence that they could make a difference.

AB  - Compared the autonomy and professional activities of 88 social workers (SWs) in hospital settings and 75 SWs in private primary-care settings. Ss responded to mailed questionnaires that included items about their professional services and the Wetzel Work Independence-Dependence Scale (J. W. Wetzel, 1984). SWs in the 2 settings did not differ in their level of perceived autonomy, and those in private primary care provided more therapy and counseling.

AB  - Identified clinically meaningful differences between 256 adult male continuous and episodic drinkers who were entering inpatient treatment on the basis of demographic, social functioning, and drinking information, as well as scores based on an intake administration of the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI). A discriminant analysis correctly classified 79% of the Ss into continuous and episodic drinking groups. variables that had both interpretable loadings on the discriminant function and scores that were associated positively with membership in the continuous drinking group included the Psychotic Thinking, Passive-Aggressive, Avoidant, and Psychotic Depression scales of the MCMI and a questionnaire item, 'Drinking helps me to work better.' Scores on the Conforming-Compulsive scale of the MCMI were associated positively with membership in the episodic drinking group. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Proposes a multiple-contingencies (MCs) theory that simultaneously examines the effects of task and dependence on work unit (WU) design and efficiency. The theory explores and predicts the conditions under which WU designs fail to fit their contexts. The proposed MC approach specifically focuses on issues such as misfit, conflicting contingencies, and equifinality. A test of the model, using data from 529 WUs in 60 employment-security offices, shows that WUs facing conflicting contingencies are more prone to design misfit and lower performance. Moreover, an MC approach (1) provided information about patterns of design in WUs that a unidimensional approach would not have, (2) isolated instances in which equifinality could be observed, and (3) provided insight into the phenomenon of the misfit and the difficulties of observing it.

AB  - This study is an extension of previous observational work on the social ecology of dependence and independence in the institutionalized elderly. Observations of everyday, naturally occurring interactions between elderly residents of two different long-term institutions and their social partners were extended such that, aside from the identification of type of behavior, the dyadic form and continuity of each behavior was specified. The following were among the major results: (a) Previously found interaction patterns between elderly residents and their social partners, replicated in both a nursing home and a home for the chronically ill, supported the notion of discrepant social ecologies for dependent versus independent behaviors of residents; (b) specification of each behavioral act as to its dyadic form underscored the fact that the interactions were controlled largely by social partners and not by the elderly residents; (c) coding continuity or discontinuity of behavior suggested that independent behaviors were maintained by chaining; and (d) elderly residents in the home for the chronically ill evinced, as expected, more dependence-related behaviors.

AB  - The authors examined the hypothesis that 3 processes underlie the defensive aspects of impression formation: (a) increased autonomic arousal after the perception of another person as a threatening stimulus, (b) defensive cognitive activity in regard to the threatening stimulus, and (c) reduction in autonomic arousal after the defensive cognitive activity. 251 male undergraduates completed the Defense Mechanism Inventory, the Dominance scale of the California Psychological Inventory, and the Succorance scale of the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule. 54 dominance- and dependency-oriented Ss observed a work dyad in which one person was substantially more dominant than the other. During their observation of this interaction, Ss expected to evaluate and later work with either the dominant or the submissive person. Ss' skin conductance was monitored as they observed and evaluated these target persons. As predicted, Ss responded to the motive-threatening target person with greater autonomic arousal; this association was stronger among Ss who typically used denial as a defense mechanism. Defensive devaluation by dominance-oriented Ss was associated with subsequent lower arousal. (40 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)
